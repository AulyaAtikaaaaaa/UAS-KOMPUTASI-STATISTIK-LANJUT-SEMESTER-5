670772142,4,2019-4,Australia,If you've ever been to Disneyland anywhere you'll find Disneyland Hong Kong very similar in the layout when you walk into main street! It has a very familiar feel. One of the rides  its a Small World  is absolutely fabulous and worth doing. The day we visited was fairly hot and relatively busy but the queues moved fairly well. ,Disneyland_HongKong
670682799,4,2019-5,Philippines,"Its been a while since d last time we visit HK Disneyland .. Yet, this time we only stay in Tomorrowland .. AKA Marvel land!Now they have Iron Man Experience n d Newly open Ant Man n d Wasp!!Ironman .. Great feature n so Exciting, especially d whole scenery of HK (HK central area to Kowloon)!Antman ..

This 1 is Great!!!For cast members (staffs) .. Felt bit MINUS point from before!!! Just dun feel like its a Disney brand!!

But, just really Dont feel it!!Bakery in Main Street now have more attractive delicacies n Disney theme sweets .. These are Good Points!!Last, they also have Starbucks now inside the theme park!!",Disneyland_HongKong
670623270,4,2019-4,United Arab Emirates,"Thanks God it wasn   t too hot or too humid when I was visiting the park   otherwise it would be a big issue (there is not a lot of shade).I have arrived around 10:30am and left at 6pm. Unfortunately I didn   t last until evening parade, but 8.5 hours was too much for me.There is plenty to do and everyone will find something interesting for themselves to enjoy.It wasn   t extremely busy and the longest time I had to queue for certain attractions was 45 minutes (which is really not that bad).Although I had an amazing time, I felt a bit underwhelmed with choice of rides and attractions. The park itself is quite small (I was really expecting something grand   even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small).The food options are good, few coffee shops (including Starbucks) and plenty of gift shops. There was no issue with toilets as they are everywhere.All together it was a great day out and I really enjoyed it.",Disneyland_HongKong
670607911,4,2019-4,Australia,"HK Disneyland is a great compact park. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of maintenance work going on at present so a number of areas are closed off (including the famous castle) If you go midweek, it is not too crowded and certainly no where near as bus as LA Disneyland. We did notice on this visit that prices for food, drinks etc have really gone through the roof so be prepared to pay top dollar for snacks (and avoid the souvenir shops if you can) Regardless, kids will love it.",Disneyland_HongKong
670607296,4,2019-4,United Kingdom,"the location is not in the city, took around 1 hour from Kowlon, my kids like disneyland so much, everything is fine.   but its really crowded and hot in Hong Kong",Disneyland_HongKong
670591897,3,2019-4,Singapore,"Have been to Disney World, Disneyland Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland but I feel that Disneyland Hong Kong is really too small to be called a Disneyland. It has way too few rides and attractions. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneyland as well. Basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to Disney. The food choices were acceptable, mostly fast food, and not too expensive. Bottled water, however, was VERY expensive but they do have water fountains around for you to refill your water bottles. The parade was pretty good. It was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was the people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines for the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget trying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i don't see how Disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst managed Disney property.",Disneyland_HongKong
670585330,5,2019-4,India,Great place! Your day will go by and you won't even know it. Obviously went there for my daughter and she absolutely loved it! Too bad the parade got canceled though.,Disneyland_HongKong
670574142,3,2019-3,Malaysia,"Think of it as an intro to Disney magic for the little ones. Almost all of the attractions can be completed in 1.5days.One drawback was the timing. For example, Disney's Storybook Theatre is closed Wed Thu for private events. Some restaurants close mid week Tue Thur as well. So best not to plan your visit during mid week.The biggest disappointment is the food at the Park. Even Maxim's is so so only. The only decent Restaurant is Main Street Corner Cafe and the Main Street Bakery. And do be prepared for the typical abrupt HongKong style service from the serving staff.",Disneyland_HongKong
670571027,2,2019-4,Australia,"Feel so let down with this place,the Disneyland train was fantastic until you get past the station,bad signage, terrible staff who just did not want to be there ,it was rainning and rides were not working could not find a map of place, over priced fun park. Disney characters only 2 seen under a cabana having photos with visitors queuing up in the rain. Dont waste your money. Walt Disney would be horrified, not enough eating places for the amount of people or rest rooms. Seems they are building something but who knows what. No atmosphere of fun and fantasy. ",Disneyland_HongKong
670570869,5,2019-3,India,"I can go on talking about Disneyland. Whatever I say about it, is less. Disneyland is all about your childhood dreams come true. Starting from the Entrance, the environment, popcorn, the shows, everything. Even the MTR Trains and the station is specially designed. In my opinion one should by a Two Day Ticket to explore it well if you have time. Else few of the attractions may remain incomplete in one day. An online Two Day Ticket can save around HKD 100 in comparison to an on spot ticket.  Must NOT Miss  attractions include the Jungle River Cruise, Micky's Phillhar Magic (a 4D Show), The Lion King ShowIt is better to have some home work regarding the Show Timings so that you can maximise the number of shows you can cover. It is better to avoid Sundays or the public holidays to avoid rush.",Disneyland_HongKong
670443403,5,2019-4,United States,Disneyland never cease to amaze me! I've been to Disneyland florida and I thought I have exhausted the kid in me but nope! I still had so much fun in disneyland hong kong. 2 DL off my bucketlist and more to come!     ,Disneyland_HongKong
670435886,5,2019-4,Canada,"We spent the day here with our grown kids and I have to admit we had a great time. It seems the kids never tire of Disney. There aren   t as many rides as the states Disney parks but they have some great ones no less. Do the haunted house, catch the lion king show, space mountain, and the iron man experience to list a few. They have lots of shops that you have to spend some money in of course. The kids will love the day!",Disneyland_HongKong
670376905,4,2019-4,Australia,"We spend two days, the second day went early then went straight to the back of the park, no lineups for so children got to go on many rides, some twice in a row. This Disneyland is very suitable for young children ours were 7,6,5,4,3 and 1 so most of them could go on all the rides, it was disappointing the castle was closed no nightly fireworks. Would not like to go in the hot season.",Disneyland_HongKong
670324965,5,2019-4,Philippines,It was indeed the happiest place on earth! My family had really fun and it made my daughter's birthday a memorable one!,Disneyland_HongKong
670274554,5,2018-9,Australia,"This place is HUGE! Definately need more than one day. We had 3 children aged 11, 9 & 6 and they loved it. A great variety of rides and attractions for all ages. Food options were fantastic with 3D models of what you were ordering. Staff were fantastic, very helpful. An awesome family experience. ",Disneyland_HongKong
670205135,3,2019-1,United Kingdom,"We brought tickets before we left and got 2 days for less than the price of 1. After visiting would advise everyone to look for an online deal not worth the walk up price. Castle was closed due to that area being refurbished and altered, weekday aprox no more than a 30 min wait for rides with most being less than that would not recommend weekends or holidays. As has been said like all Disney parks and theme parks in general food and drink is expensive .This is a small park and can easily be done in 1 day",Disneyland_HongKong
670199487,4,2019-4,Myanmar (Burma),"Its huge , not enough to visit in one day. We did with 2 days pass ... all the scenes were amazing ... you were like in movies, fairytales, etc. At 8 pm, we have enjoyed lots with the character show on the street. Must Visit !!! ",Disneyland_HongKong
670129921,3,2019-4,United Kingdom,Around   60 per person and if you want to eat or drink at any point it was cost you a small fortune. If you go on a week day like we did I assume like us you will wait around half an hour per ride. At the time we went the Disney castle was under construction.. it doesn't look like it will be finished soon. Fast track is free for everyone but single rider was a lot faster. An average day at an expensive place. ,Disneyland_HongKong
670099231,4,2019-4,Australia,It   s Disneyland! It just does not need reviewing!  Place speaks for itself.  However smaller than I expected.  Great experience,Disneyland_HongKong
670033848,5,2018-11,Hong Kong,There is nothing more to say except that you become a child once again as you step inside Disneyland in HK!  Easy to go and come out with dedicated trams and subway stations.  Wait for the parade at sunset it is definitely worth waiting!,Disneyland_HongKong
670030877,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"We bought a 2 day tourist ticket via Klook which made it better value. It was good to have a day to get our bearings and a second day to go on the rides we missed and to go back on our favourite ones again. It also means less queuing.The shows and parades were amazing. We saw the Lion King, Moana and Mickey   s Wondrous Book. Unfortunately there is some works on so the Castle isn   t visible and the train is not open. We still had a magical time.  ",Disneyland_HongKong
670022335,3,2019-4,United States,"First off I'm not a really big Disneyland fan. I live about 20 minutes from the California Disneyland, and haven't been in over 10 years (by choice). We were on vacation in Hong Kong and were able to get free tickets, so why not. First getting there by subway from downtown was super easy. I will say I was impressed with how the train that takes you there was decked out in all the Disney themes. Next the park was okay just super small compared to the one here in California. The castle was under construction so that kinda of sucks and the train didn't run. We went on a Wednesday so it was slow. There are not a lot of rides, so please don't come with that idea. It's a nice place for little kids, but thrill seekers stay at home. One tip make sure you read the description of each ride before you wait in line, because I will never get those 30 minutes of my life back (Iron man experience).",Disneyland_HongKong
670007081,3,2019-4,United States,Mickey and the Wounderous book was great and the kids love it. The new Ant man attraction was good for all ages. Our four year old love the pubs afraid waiting in line because of the loud noises. The 10 year old was afraid of Iron Man   s ride it   s good for 12 and I   ll probably but it was a great ride. The castle is under major construction so there   s no fireworks. Overall the park is still beautiful and wonderful to visit and buy the teacup ride there is a good restaurant that has Standard Chinese food at reasonable prices for Disney. You   ll Have a great day or two. Still probably the best attraction in Hong Kong for children one of the top two for sure. Adults can go on roller coasters and other rides as well they will not be disappointed. ,Disneyland_HongKong
669996858,3,2019-4,Singapore,"I   ve been to Hong Kong Disneyland twice and even with new attractions such as the Ant Man and the Wasp, the experience was really flat and not as enjoyable as other Disneylands in the region. With Sleeping Beauty Castle under renovation, pictures taken at the main square isn   t that appealing with the scaffolding in sight. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneylands. ",Disneyland_HongKong
669783708,5,2019-4,Australia,"GO early if you want to do photos with the signboards and Mickey Donald Duck. Otherwise, you could spend an hour just waiting in line to get a free photo. The paid photo is also available at a price.Tomorrow land Iron Man was excellent and we did it twice.Philar Magic is really awesome.Fantasy Land is great for the rides.Adventure Land has some nice opportunities to take photos with Tarzan, a treetop house visit, a boat cruise for kids.Grizzly Gulch was one of my favourites, Roller Coaster ride was worth the 15 minute wait.",Disneyland_HongKong
669548161,3,2019-4,Hong Kong,Disneylands the world over are generic apart from the language. This was no different than the others. It was a shame about all the building work and some closed eating areas.  Definitely worth a visit if you have young children.,Disneyland_HongKong
669528186,3,2019-4,Australia,"This was my second trip here, the first been about 3 years ago. This is a smallish Disneyland park. The attractions are of a high standard but there are few thrill rides and no outdoor roller coaster. The park was clean and tidy. Food was expensive in the park not of an excellent qualify (ie served like warm or cold) and there were few vegetarian options.The castle was under renovation at the time of my visit. The park is easy to walk around and many of the attractions are great for kids. Lines were virtually non existent with our longest wait 20 minutesOverall worth a visit if you are with the kids in Hong Kong and have the time. The park entry is also comparatively inexpensive when compared to other Disneyland parks.",Disneyland_HongKong
669403596,5,2018-12,Philippines,We have been to Hong Kong Disneyland a few times already but we still want to come back. Why? Because there are rides we were too chicken to try the first visits that we finally had the courage to try and we ended up loving them. We love the Big Grizzly Mountain ride. We thought it will be too scary but we love it now. Will be back again!,Disneyland_HongKong
669353396,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,We visited here on a Wednesday. We arrived for opening and found the queue times to be short and had done most the rides we wanted to by early afternoon. Unfortunately there were no fireworks due to the castle being renovated and we have seen many parades at Disney world so we decided not to stay for the evening. ,Disneyland_HongKong
669186152,3,2019-4,Australia,"I need to say I have been to    home of Disney    Disneyland Anaheim. HK Disney is about an 8th of that park!    Biggest ride    (as in scary) was Space Mountain. Mostly kiddy rides other than that. We did really enjoy the Lion King show. I can   t get over how expensive it was. Water equates to $6 AUD a small bottle and a burger combo meal equated $22 AUD!!!! We also stayed at Disney Hollywood Hotel   where they have u by the balls and charge insane prices ($120 AUD) for buffet dinner or $55 AUD for breakfast. There are no shops   cafes   supermarkets nearby to grab a snack or cheap dinner, unless u take 2 trains! After travelling thru HK  China for 3 weeks it was just crazy expensive for crappy deep fried food or a flavourless bowl of lettuce salad. Very few food places open. Castle under maintenance. Train under maintenance. vouchers we got on the way in stating ALL shops on main st have 10% discount before 1030... then told at bakery    that not here   ?!!! At home that   s called false advertising?!! Toy Story land was insanely hot   no shade, sun bouncing off light concrete   my husband actually had a hypo while waiting for daughter on ride coz it   s so hot. Come on Disneyland... surely you can put up some    camo style shades    so waiting parents don   t pass out?! A few seats for elderly wouldn   t go astray either. All up pretty disappointing experience and about $900 AUD poorer, for 2 adults & 1 child for 2 day pass (note: u won   t need to go back for a second day). ",Disneyland_HongKong
669093045,5,2019-4,Australia,"Took a five year old and a two year old. Could not fault anything other than a hire pram being pinched, which was quickly replaced.  Staff amazing. If you can stay at one of the hotels, do so.  Makes it all much easier.",Disneyland_HongKong
669050447,4,2019-4,Australia,"A great day out even for adults.We can early and we're able to do almost all rides in a couple of hours. The restaurants were great and a good selection of different foods. Try the caramel popcorn! Unfortunately, when we went the bars and 1 restaurant was closed, but still other options available.The rides are mostly for little kids bit a couple were good for adults. The shopping was the highlight of the day with huge selection of Disney gifts and clothing. Note if there is a daily special get it early as it will sell out. There is not a lot of shade so bring hats and an umbrella.",Disneyland_HongKong
668819140,5,2019-4,Australia,"I went to Hong Kong Disneyland with a little trepidation as our family had been to Disneyland in California 6 months previously.No trepidation needed, we all loved HKDL! Loved loved loved it.Yes, its much smaller than California and there are not as many fast paced rides, none the less, we had a great day. The park is beautiful and the experience is just like being at Anaheim.We went on a day where large amounts of rain were expected, so numbers were down. We had line ups of less than 5 minutes on most rides. The rain held off until 3pm and we'd been able to go through all of the park by that time and we were going back over rides we wanted to do again. Once the rain started we found that most people huddled under their umbrellas, where as we went on all the undercover rides over and over.I totally recommend HKDL, just keep in mind it is smaller and slower paced than other Disney parks.",Disneyland_HongKong
668798543,5,2019-4,China,"This Disneyland is a lot of fun. There are many rides that are good like the Iron man experience, hyperspace mountain, the toy story car, and many others. I went to Shanghai Disneyland as well and that one is so crowded you can   t go on a lot of rides but in Hong Kong we were able to ride almost every ride in a day. Lines were very short and the park is small so it   s easy to get around. ",Disneyland_HongKong
668777351,4,2018-12,Australia,"We have been to Disneyland in LA two times, and Tokyo Disneyland Disney Sea. Walking through the gates at HK Disneyland felt like going back to LA. This is because the park is owned by Disney and HK Government. We loved the quietness of HK Disneyland in the morning, most things in HK don't open until 10am, so to walk in with very few people in front of us was great. Toy Storyland doesn't open until 11am. We purchased our tickets online from Australia and printed them before we left. You are sent an email with a link to an electronic version with QR codes and personalised characters, but we used the printed version much easier and the website can be a little slow. We also purchased the Dining Vouchers as well, this entitled us to Lunch or Dinner a popcorn or a iceblock. If you are there for two days, like we were then just double the number of vouchers you purchase. HK Disneyland uses the old style Fast pass system, scan your ticket and get a printed fastpass. We were staying at Disney Explorers Lodge and received fast passes to certain rides from there as well. The food in HK Disneyland is aimed at the Asian Market, although there are restaurants who serve burgers etc. If you have fussy eaters then beware you may have limited choices, but over all the food was Disney quality. We ate at the Starliner Restaurant at Tomorrowland.We loved Space Mountain with the Star Wars overlay, sooo coool. The is no Pirates of the Caribbean ride, sad, but the Lion King show and Mickey's PhilharMagic shows are great fun.Unique to the HK Disneyland is Mystic Manor, an amazing trackless ride so fun we went on it three times, the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars is great fun, the experience varies depending on where you are sitting, we had front row, amazing, and last row, still fun but a little rough. Also unique to HK Disneyland is the Iron Man Experience, a ride simulator on a Stark Industries flyer through Hong Kong. Lots of fun.When you ride the Jungle Cruise remember to choose the English line or Cantonese line as the skippers script is done in both. They say there is no difference in the line waiting time, we didn't really notice it.Yes HKL Disneyland is smaller than LA Disneyland  Tokyo Disneyland but two days allows you to see pretty much everything and not a break net speed. We are a Disney loving family and our girls were aged 17, 15, and 10 when we attended the park. The Christmas decorations and the parade were great.HK Disneyland is on the MTR line just change at Sunny Bay Station for the Disneyland line. You can use your Octopus Card to travel on the MTR. There are shuttle buses that run from the Disney Hotels to the transport hub at Disneyland and you can walk if you want to along the bay from the hotels. It would be roughly 20 minutes walk from the Disneyland Hotel along the bay. There is also a ferry that runs from Central to HK Disneyland but the MTR train is the best option in my opinion, especially as it has Mickey Shaped Windows and Disney theming inside the train carriages.",Disneyland_HongKong
668611003,4,2019-4,Australia,Australian family of four with 2 kids (12 and 9) enjoyed a full day out at Hong Kong Disneyland with plenty to do and see.If you have been to other Disney's and get a chance to visit Hong Kong   I say definitely do it. There are a couple of unique Hong Kong experiences including two Marvel attractions   Antman and Ironman   both which we enjoyed.For thrill seekers there are a couple of great rides   The Big Grizzly Mountain was probably our favourite   it was unexpected and fast. And the RC Racer in Toystoryland definitely worth the wait.For families with younger kids there is heaps here to do   we kind of skipped fantasyland   but for young families you would probably spend a lot of the day here.The park is easy to get to as well   the dedicated Disney train line was fun to ride on   and with an easily navigable MTR in Hong Kong it was simple and cheap to get to the Park.,Disneyland_HongKong
668374644,4,2019-4,United Kingdom,"If your are travelling to Disney land from mong cok you can purchase your tickets from one of the travel shops at a discounted rate (we purchased ours from Hong Thai travel) this is in the bank centre on Nathan road, right next to the Mong Kok station.   if you go to level 4 there are numerous travel shops (including CTS) which from other reviews that I read is where most people purchased the tickets. We asked around the shops on level 4 for the price of their Disneyland ticket (including CTS) and we found Hong Thai travel the cheapest. The tickets were $557HKD each for adults. I would recommend asking around each shop for their price on the day. They seem to all open at 10am. The sales advisor will hand you a letter which you then take to the box office at Disney land and swap for entry tickets   it was very easy and we had no problems. Hong Thai travel Bank centre Nathan roadAs the park opened at 10.30am we decided to get a taxi on the way there, this costs roughly $200HKD from Mong Kok and takes around 20 minutes.On the way back we used the trains, the route is:Disney land to Sunny Bay (pink line)Sunny Bay to Lai King Station (orange line)Lai King Station to Mong Kok (red line)The trains costs are around $20HKD and takes roughly 1 hour.  if you want to catch the train to Disneyland from Mong Kok the route is;Mong Kok to Lai King Station (red line)Lai King Station to Sunny Bay Station (orange line)Sunny Bay Station to Disneyland (pink line)",Disneyland_HongKong
668242919,4,2019-4,Australia,"Hong Kong is easy to get to via the MTR from Kowloon, great signage and fast. Our day started well but just after arriving it started to rain quite heavily and didn't stop until mid afternoon. Characters were out in the main street but only saw two during the day, probably due to the rain. Even though the crowds on entry were big once inside it didn't seem crowded at all, Toy Story Land was a ghost town with no one going on the rides in the rain. We enjoy the rides that were open and all in all had a good day. Had heard great things about Mystic Manor but found it just okay, loved Hyperspace Mountain, Ant Man and Ironman. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars were my favorite of the day! Though shopping wasn't as good as Disneyland in the USA which was disappointing, catering mainly to children. Happy to have visited but don't think I'd go to Hong Kong again.",Disneyland_HongKong
668209978,5,2018-9,Australia,You have to visit to understand the memorable experience. It is a place that brings out the child in everyone. You have to stay for the fireworks. Food is expensive so take snacks along.,Disneyland_HongKong
668111738,5,2018-6,Hong Kong,"HKDL got different event for different period. Like Jan Feb for Chines New Year, Apr May for Spring Carnival, then Summer, Halloween and Christmas, each event got different theme for both charaters costume and decorate, and sometimes might got the special daily parade too. Thats why recommend to check clearly which event you want to join before you make the disney trip. If you don't like crowded, Mar & November without any event happening will be your choice!",Disneyland_HongKong
667962395,3,2019-4,United States,The park is great if this is the only amusement park available to you. It is small and the rides are very tame. The park can be done in 3 4 of a day. Disney is always clean and has the best customer service.,Disneyland_HongKong
667949538,5,2019-4,Australia,"Visited here with the family and had a very memorable experience. It didn   t seem as big as Anaheim, but very clean and well maintained.  Received priority queuing passes but didn   t need them as the lines were very short.",Disneyland_HongKong
667897767,4,2019-3,Philippines,"It's always going to be fun at Disneyland. These are a few of my reminders: don't bring selfie sticks and huge tripods you can bring bottled water or if you have a reusable container, use that instead food can be expensive so eat plenty before going here. Just don't ride the rollercoasters right away. don't miss the Festival of the Lion King Show. You can forget the Moana production though if you're expecting the songs from the movie and to see Maui wear comfortable shoes. there will be lots of walking have fun and don't get discouraged by long queues. you'll have your turn sooner than you think.",Disneyland_HongKong
667633252,4,2019-2,United States,"To be honest it rained nearly all day, if the weather was better i'm sure my overall impression would have been much better. It lacks the thrill seeking rides of other disney parks. That being said it also lacked the ridiculously long quees. Waits were around 5 minutes! ",Disneyland_HongKong
667600609,4,2018-10,United Kingdom,"A super small but cute Disney park   if you're a Disney fan you tick this park off in a day though, be warned, if you're used to the service in Walt Disney World and Disneyland, it doesn't seem to  translate  as well at Hong Kong Disneyland. The food is also not as good   we had lunch from the Lucky Nugget Saloon, which was mediocre at best.A fun day though, regardless.",Disneyland_HongKong
667509247,4,2019-4,United States,"Plaza Inn was fantastic, and the kids in our group loved the rides. It   s smaller than Disneyland, but if you love Disney, it   s worth the visit. If you   re not super into Disney, I   d probably skip and just go to Disneyland in Anaheim.",Disneyland_HongKong
667288224,5,2019-3,Australia,"We first did Disneyworld in Orlando some 40 yrs ago with our 2 year old.Back then, we had to buy different value tickets for various rides whereas that has changed and the entry fee now covers all rides etc, except for food. What hasn   t changed. The place is remarkably clean and well maintained given the number of visitors they see each day. Some rides had a long wait ie 40 minutes, so skipped them till later in the day ie 4 5pm, and the wait period was down to less than 10minutes.A very full day. We got there around 10.30 am and left when the street parade finished at around 9.15pm. Exhausting, but simply loved it ",Disneyland_HongKong
667095433,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"Had a great time at Disneyland. Great, but can be busy on Saturday and Sunday. Only point to note, is that the park opens at 10:00 but the first zone does not open until 10:30. I purchased priority tickets, if going at the weekend I would recommend priority tickets. Queues smaller during the week and not sure if priority needed.",Disneyland_HongKong
667093819,4,2019-4,Australia,"We had a terrific time at Disneyland HongKong   rides were fun, waiting times ok, shows were enjoyable, very clean, staff super friendly   only let down was average food but to be expected.",Disneyland_HongKong
667079818,5,2019-4,Australia,"Even though the rain set in for most of the day, as an adult we still had a fun time at Disneyland Hong Kong",Disneyland_HongKong
667072981,3,2019-3,Australia,"Good to see while here, but very small. Great if we brought the children, but not for adults who have been to other ones. Not exciting for bigger children either.",Disneyland_HongKong
667023629,5,2019-4,United States,"I love Disney, I even worked at Disney World in college so when we came to Hong Kong I knew we had to visit. I didn't visit the one in Paris when I went and I regret it. Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest of the Disney Parks. We were able to ride all the rides in 3 hours when we first arrived at 9:30 a.m. I loved the Wondrous Book of Mickey and the Mystic Manor ride. I also liked the new Ant Man and Wasp ride b c it's like the Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger's ride in Orlando. I also liked how all the characters were dressed up for Easter and the Easter decorations they had up as well. I loved both parades, the afternoon and the night time one reminded me of the Electro Magic Parade that was in Orlando. If you're a Disney fan then you must visit Hong Kong Disneyland!",Disneyland_HongKong
666934099,5,2019-4,Singapore,"Small disneyland catering to kids, but they have some nice rides including the new Ant Man ride. Pricey food and somewhat long queues but that is part of the theme park. Try to go in the morning and then again in the evening, best is to stay one day at the hotel to maximize the park.",Disneyland_HongKong
666902517,4,2019-4,Indonesia,"It was very essay to go from the city to Disney central Station. We bought tickets on sight with the additional VIP Status so that we didn't have to line up.It was a week day and the park was not full  it was heaven. My only downside to the experience was that the main castle that appears on all their publicity was under reparation and it was very hard to find a restaurant with a variation of vegetarian food unless you liked pop corn, corn on the cob or a vegie burger in one of their fast food outlets. We really enjoyed our selves and so will you. Mind you I am 50 and my friend is 30 something...so it works for adults as well.",Disneyland_HongKong

I would definitely recommend for a family day out.",Disneyland_HongKong
666333440,3,2018-8,China,It was ok. This Disney is more catered for smaller children rather than adults. Some of the areas were closed. There was only one really thrilling ride. the rest are for children. Maybe needs a few more western restaurants as well.,Disneyland_HongKong

Book online from klook app to get discount. This only saves time as on spot booking as long que.3. Always reach disneyland by its special metro train as its interior is superb and gives you great feel.4. Take map or use free wifi to access their app for show timings and ride schedule.5. Do not miss any of the live shows as they are worth watching and direction is highly creative.6. Always ask from disneyland employees at ride entrance exit for stickers as they usually keep and gives it for free as soveniour, even when you leav door person can also give you some JUST REMEMBER TO ASK POLITELY.Rest this is worth visiting and whatever age group you belong you cannot miss DISNEYLAND LA LA LAND!!!",Disneyland_HongKong

666237713,5,2018-5,Sri Lanka,Superb atmosphere in HK Disneyland. Must enter the park by 8am soon it   s opened and have more than enough things to do until dawn. Better check which amusements are under renovation as usually it has 1 or 2 parks under construction everyday. If this is your last item in HK tour you can check in luggage at Kowloon station and visit Disneyland. But recommend to reserve two day ticket if you want to try out all excursions.

665910063,4,2019-3,United States,My son and his wife and three children recently visited Disney HK. They had a great time exploring it and said there were virtually no lines!!The one fault they found was in the food. Children   s food was very lacking in variety and taste. Our grandson who must be gluten free had no selections on the children   s menu that he could eat. They had to purchase a $60 steak that was not the best either. They have frequented Disney in the US and it is very conscious of allergies and gluten free menu items are readily available. I would implore the Hong Kong ownership of this American icon to be more sensitive to these needs and make some much needed improvements to their menus.,Disneyland_HongKong
665808902,5,2019-2,United States,Took some family to park for their first time at a Disney park. They loved it and it was a joy to see the kid in their eyes as they enjoyed all that it had to offer. Weather was great as well.,Disneyland_HongKong

665245861,5,2019-4,Indonesia,"Who wouldn   t enjoy Disneyland? Hong Kong Disneyland is really easy to access. They have special metro to Disneyland and special designed. You better get there before 10 and directly queue until the parks open (at 10), so once it open you can enjoy many rides without long queue. Just be there on weekdays, avoid weekends!For muslim traveler, you shouldn   t be worry since you can find halal restaurant inside called Tahitian Terrace. It is located close to Tarzan   s Treehouse. The price ranges from 120 150 HKD if i   m not mistaken. I enjoy big rides but avoid big thrill drop. I   ve tried almost all rides except Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. Shame, i   m afraid of fast backward drop lol.

665132719,5,2019-4,Uganda,"We bought a package through the Disney website. We started at the Explorers lodge and the package included several priority passes (like fast passes). We actually never needed to use them because the longest wait time for a ride was 10 minutes. All of the shows and rides are in English and most cast members speak English really well. This park is the smallest of Disneyland parks in the world, but we still felt like there was enough to keep us busy for our day and a half that we were there. The bus shuttles were very clean and ran on time.Would definitely go again next time we are in Hong Kong.",Disneyland_HongKong

664668402,2,2019-4,Singapore,"I went to HK Disneyland on 5 April which happens to be Qing Ming festival and did not expect the massive crowds on that day. Queues for rides and F&B outlets were very long and we did not have a great experience especially with a young kid. For the amount spent on the tickets, it's really a waste of money as we only sat on a few rides. I'm wondering if the park has any cap on the number of guests in the park as we had a hard time finding seats around. I booked my tickets via the Disneyland Hotel online but there was no info or confirmation given to me whether my park tickets are booked. In the end, I was unable to enter and had to buy tickets on the spot. Luckily, one of the cast members, Carmen, helped us to resolve the issue and let us access without queuing up again. Also the balloons there are overrpriced   HK150 for a helium balloon.",Disneyland_HongKong
664665673,5,2019-4,Canada,We have been to LA and Florida Disney MANY times so we were told we would be disappointed with this one. Not at all! We loved it. It had different rides and shows while still having the same layout and Disney feel. It is expanding a whole lot at the moment. My suggestion would be to add more food restaurants as the food lines were as long as the ride liens. We purchased online tickets and bought a partial ride upgrade. We wanted the full ride upgrade but it was sold out for the day. IMHO it is well worth it! We spent opening to closing there and loved it. The midway games were fun,Disneyland_HongKong

In fact, we played 4 times all together and if time allowed, we would play more ! Take the ride disregarding your age when you visit Hong Kong Disney and have fun.",Disneyland_HongKong

664378631,5,2019-4,India,"Everyone loves Disneyland !!! If you are traveling with young kids I would really recommend staying at one of the three Disney hotels. The hotels provide coaches, thereby making it more convinient. We stayed at the Disney hotel for two nights, the high point being the visit by the Disney characters at breakfast .  We also took a two day pass, it made the whole experience more relaxed and easy going.  Vegetarian food is only available at one of the restaurants. But the taste and quantity is good.  The park itself is well designed. There are enough options to engage very young kids to older kids.  The parade is not to be missed, as well as the different photo opps with all the Disney characters.  Other than the rides my kids really enjoyed the opportunity to dress up as young Jedi   s n fight the evil forces . A great family vacation. ",Disneyland_HongKong
664132845,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"This was a true highlight of our trip, they suspend reality so well in the park each lands attention to detail is incredible in decor, the sounds   smells, the staffs costumes and personas. There is truly something for everyone of all ages. The lines where very well managed with even on opening day of the new marvel ride just around 40 mins wait. Make sure you use smart fast track passes where you can they are free at some rides.It   s fair to say this park is much smaller than the others but somehow in that it becomes so much more charming.The staff could not do more for people bending over backwards they clearly love their jobs. They just seemed to intuitively just know what people needed.Would strongly recommend anyone with a day or two to spare. The current two day ticket offer was great for us as we did most of the flagship rides day one and the show and on the second day the other items.With this very close proximity to the airport and cheap bag storage it   s an ideal place to stop over or visit on your last day like we did heading straight to the airport after.

664091514,5,2019-4,United States,Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely a must see. It is a smaller park but what it loses in size it makes up for in quality. Hong Kong is currently home to the only Marvel themed rides and they do not disappoint. Hong Kong has many of the standard rides shows you expect from Disney but it also maintains a variety of exclusives. Hong Kong also has a lot of exclusive merchandise especially pins. Also most if not all of the rides are Bilingual. ,Disneyland_HongKong
663693003,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"Buy your discounted tickets on Klook (thus no ticket queueing when you arrive), get the MTR to Disneyland (35 mins from Hong Kong station where we had breaky at the Pret A Manger in the shopping mall there.). Take in lots of water as it   s expensive in the park. We also took in kids food and snacks as they are expensive and not great quality, you get searched on entry by if you have a good bag with many compartments, it   s easy to hide! Get there at 1015am latest and when the gates open at 1030am go straight for the Star Wars or ToyStory area. Only 2 or 3 rides have the fast pass, if you want to go to the Winnie the Pooh, use it there as the queue was long. Toy story land was great and big queues for the green parachute ride, so that   s one to go to first if you don   t start with Star Wars. The 245pm street show was very good (no need to get there early) but we were disappointed not to see the lion king show that is not currently on (download the free Disney HK App   will tell you what   s happening when). The Lion King show is a not to miss apparently and you have to get there before the street show ends or you might not get in. Recommend the musical show in the big Theatre, that   s next to the Small world. Saw the 1230pm show with lots of singing and Mickey Mouse and goofy !Our highlight of the day though was Mine train  amazing. Went on it 5 times.All in all, a good long day out   too tired to stay for the 730pm lights show !",Disneyland_HongKong

We left the hotel at 8.30 am even though the park didn   t open until 10.30. I   m glad we did as it took a little while to get there and get tickets etc. We bought the Priority line pass for an extra HKD$299 but it was a big waste of money as the park wasn   t busy and we only had to wait once for a ride. As the park wasn   t busy there were many food shops that were not open. Our kids (13 and 10) loved the rides and went of a few of them several times. My 10 year old cried when we were leaving as she didn   t want to go   so she must of had a good day!

Having just gone to Tokyo Disneyland in February and comparing with this one in Hong Kong, I would say that this is a smaller theme park. However, they have packed quite a lot of activities and rides into a smaller area so there are still a lot to do for a day. In fact, Hong Kong Disneyland is newer and has more updated areas such as Iron Man and the upcoming Ant Man. Not very crowded when we were there during a week day but there are still short queues for the rides.The parades during the day and night were similar with most Disneyland but shorter and not as many floats. Went for the Mickey show as well as Lion King shows and they were enjoyable.",Disneyland_HongKong

We had a great time here, but compared to Paris, Tokyo and Florida (the others I've visited) it was very small with a limited number of rides and no real thrill rides. Space Mountain was very tame compared to all other versions.I'm serious about my Disney parks but struggled to fill two days here   I'd recommend only visiting for one day.The highlight was the shows   the Lion King show and the Wondrous Book were the best quality shows I've seen in any Disney park.

We purchased our tickets onsite and used the online 10% discount for foreign travelers just by showing the web page and our drivers licenses. Much easier than buying online. I downloaded the app and it was great as a map and to track wait times for the rides. Most rides had 5 to 40 min waits. I recommend getting the fast pass for Dumbo as it was the only line that took MUCH longer than the advertised wait time. We were able to get on all the rides and still make it back on the MTR at a decent time but the train was pretty packed.

662233037,5,2019-3,United Kingdom,"We tried to buy our tickets online the day before but after entering payment details it said try later. We tried with a different card and it still gave the same message. The credit card company said the payment was taken but we had not received a booking confirmation. We took a taxi from TST area and it was not expensive and in an air conditioned car it was a pleasant journey. We arrived about 10:30. The next day at the park we had to waste time at guest relations where we were told the payments had not been taken, so we bought our tickets at the park. We will need to check our card statements to ensure no payments have been taken!We did not know if we should add the priority pass to our tickets as there was no information on how long the queues were at the entrance, unlike parks we have visited in the US, so we purchased them.Whilst at The Iron Man ride the priority cards were scanned on entry then scanned again before getting on. This is where two of the priority rides were recorded as used but it should only have been recorded as once   we did not know this at the time. When we tried to use our priority pass for the 3rd time later we were told we had none left. This was very embarrassing in front of the other park Guests. We said it could have occurred at Iron Man as they scanned it twice and was told to go back to Iron Man! We were tired by this point from going around the park and did not want to walk back there and so said we would go to Guest Relations instead. Guest Relations were not apologetic. We were offered the priority ticket for our next visit but we are from the UK and do not expect to return! We were offered a soft drink or popcorn   whoopy dah! We had just had lunch   no thank you. So we left with it not being resolved to our satisfaction.Please be careful if you buy online and if you have purchased a priority pass!The queues were about 15 30 minutes.We did have a great time at Disney but the pre purchase and priority pass experiences have left us feeling dissatisfied rather than elated and we still need to check payments had not been taken, so our negative Disney experience continues, even once back in the UK for the next few weeks.",Disneyland_HongKong

661955342,3,2019-3,Australia,"We were disappointed with HK Disneyland. The train wasn't running and the Castle was under renovation, as were several other areas. It had an air of dilapidation. Our coach driver advised us to take food in, not in our bags, which would be searched, but in our pockets. The reason for this was that They want to make you pay the incredibly high prices for food they sell. He also suggested not buying souvenirs there, but taking a picture, then getting the item from Ali Baba (or Ali Express I suppose). A basic souvenir mug cost A$20 approx, and watches were about A$80. The parade though, was fantastic, and made up a lot for the rest of it. It's on twice a day, in the afternoon and evening. The fireworks that we'd previously seen there were suspended for a while, due to the renovations. An MTR station is right there at the gates   change at Central for other lines. There's also a ferry but it limits you to certain times of leaving, so MTR, taxi or bus is better. For a senior, HK$2 on the Oyster Seniors card gets you all the way back to a station close to your hotel, so don't bother with a tour. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Its just sad that the afternoon parade was cancelled. But during the night when the weather cleared, HK Disneyland pushed through the Paint the Night Parade.

Love seeing my little one enjoying Disneyland. ",Disneyland_HongKong

I have previously been to Disneyland Anaheim, Disney World Florida, Disneyland Paris, Tokyo Disneyland Disneysea. HK Disneyland is tiny, but fortunately not many crowds. The haunted house (mystic manor) was weird, though. I would expect something along the lines of other Disneyland parks, but yeah maybe it   s a cultural thing (nothing beats haunted house in Universal Studios Singapore during Halloween Horror Nights, fyi). Overall, my kids had fun there. Main reason why we went to Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong

Hyperspace mountain, grizzly mountain, jungle cruise, Mystic Manor and Iron man experience are a must do rides. better to buy tickets food combos from klook. you do not have to stand in queue. just scan barcode and enter. Also, most importantly, take your food coupons just after entry so that you do not ahve to return later to get the coupons. We went to Royal Banquet hall for food. average food. carry water bottle as water is expensive there.",Disneyland_HongKong

We went on Wed. and the line was short. Only from 5 minutes to 15 minutes wait. Unheard of in the USA. You can get here easily with MTR. Expect to spend a day here. They open at 10 am.

You only need one day here.",Disneyland_HongKong

Yes, it is expensive and small but it has tons of rides for all ages.As an HK resident, I always go to Hk Disneyland and the experience is the same every time. Whether it is the parade or the rides, the park is incredible. There has been tons of revamps in the past few years with the farewells to Autopia and Buzz Lightyear Astroblasters but has been replaced with a brand new section in Tomorrowland featuring Iron Man and Ant Man coming in April as well as a brand new revamp of Space Mountain. The staff are extremely helpful and the gift shops have loads of merchandise and souvenirs. The park is also extremely kid friendly. The only negative I can extract from this park is the food price. The food isn't that bad but for it's quality, it is way too expensive. Since visitors aren't allowed to bring food in, you might have to starve for a day or buy an expensive meal.If you have lots of free time in HK and want something enjoyable whether with the kids or with your mates, HK Disney is a great park although if you are a major thrill seeker, Ocean Park would be more suited for you.",Disneyland_HongKong

There was construction with a lot of noise during our visit. It was ridiculous to visit the enchanted forest when you heard a jackhammer!! The maneges are limited. The prices are high for the quality of the park. It is better to keep your money and invest it in another activity ",Disneyland_HongKong

They had a few big parades around the theme park at certain hours, the last one was at 2000 hrs. To avoid rushing back with other visitors, I tried staying back after the last parade and got on the MTR after most of the visitors had left.The theme park provide strollers for rent, be careful not to lose the deposit slip or they wouldn't cash your deposit when you return the strollers.My kids enjoyed every parade especially the last one at 2000 hrs, with all the lightworks and Disney characters out on the street.",Disneyland_HongKong

As usual, even on a Mondays, the queing for the long lines of activities will leave you to make ceratin choice events, rides, etc. We did get a roller coaster ride on Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain, photos taken w the Iron Man who was strutting around for poses w us, parades, store buys, etc. But what made the stay most memorable was the live presentation of Lion King musical wc made the final cut of our 'one day' experience @ Disney memorable!",Disneyland_HongKong

My grandson does not want to go to Theatre but changed his mind after this show. Staff were sometimes too busy talking to other staff to assist and sometimes abrupt.

Bought the recommended value set to maximise it but the burger was so pathetic, small, flat and the meat was half. ",Disneyland_HongKong

My favourite ride was the Mystic Manor   it has nothing to do with Disney, but a great little story which is a bit funny and has amazing detail in the ride. I believe it   s for HK only so really special. The run away train is quite deceiving, it starts of slow and you start to think it   s a bit rubbish...but it then surprises you. A winner with us. We got our tickets with Klook as this was by far the cheapest. It even came with the option for a meal deal which was did as it mean we didn   t have to worry about that. The food at Disney wasn   t great but ok. They are working on the castle at the moment and think it may take a while. At the moment it   s tiny! We found it so odd seeing the castle like this, but it   s because they didn   t have the money to build a bit castle. They do not so fireworks at the moment because of this but they are doing a light show at Main Street which was good. HK Disney has a toy story land, built before the one in Orlando. It   s really good but I love toy story. ",Disneyland_HongKong

There is a special train that takes you there. There is an obsession with Duffy at the park. We went on a week day and entered when the park first opened. The only lines we encountered were for the characters. Easy to do in 1 day. Lots of great food options that is not your typical Disney fare. We quite enjoyed the time spent there.",Disneyland_HongKong

This park does not open until 10.30am, but we arrived earlier as we decided to buy our ticket on the gate rather than do this by phone. Surprisingly enough it was a very easy and quick process, just had to show our passportsWe got on the metro from Hong Kong to Sunny Bay station, crossed the platform to catch the Disneyland train which was only one stop.Seeing that this was a Monday the amount of people waiting for the park to open was massive, bug bear is that nearly everyone is on their phones and then you have to put up with them doing a 101 selfies. (please if you love yourself that much just get a mirror). Anyway the announcement was NOT TO RUN when they opened the gates, BUT WHAT did they all do RUN, no manners at all, push and shoved.This park is not a patch on the original Disney in Florida. There are very few rides and you can get round this park so quick. This is certainly not worth the   60 plus for adults .The atmosphere is certainly not here either, maybe because it was not very warm.",Disneyland_HongKong

It   s the happiest place on earth, and it   s great.It is a small park, at least by Anaheim and Tokyo standards, and can be easily covered in a few hours. This leaves plenty of time for shopping and hitting the rides you like multiple times.We came on a Tuesday in early March and arrived at park open. The weather was nice out, but the lines were, thankfully, almost non existent. Even after the usual busy times of 1 2pm, most lines were less than 15 mins.We bought a priority pass, but in hindsight it wasn   t at all required. In the end we just used it to get the value, but we were really just skipping 5 minute queues, so it was a waste of money on this particular occasion.

There are enough rides and attractions to make the trip worthwhile, and it is very easily accessible by the MTR Trains. Main disappointment Wes that there were no characters strolling thru the park to mingle with visitors. That may be because of overcast and potentially rainy skies. In any case, the weather also kept lines for rides very short   5 to 19 min max. No fast pass needed. I also like this Disneyland because you can still visit all the variety of parks paying one fee.

It's said that it's only available in Hong Kong, no other Mystic Manor in any other Disneyland. So we had to go there! Although it wasn't a thrilling ride, it was still fun & very amusing for us. The MM souvenirs were also very cute. We spent quite amount of money there, because no other MM souvenirs at any other Disneyland shop (not even at the shop at the Hong Kong Airport!).

I've already hit Orlando, Anaheim and Paris, this is my fourth location (Tokyo in 2020 and Shanghai 2021). Although this park is slightly larger than Anaheim it doesn't really feel like it. They have fewer attractions crammed into a small space like the original. Overall the park is clean, themed well and all the cast members we came into contact with were pleasant. I don't think you can compare Disney parks to each other, it's just not fair. I like the HK version although a lot of the attractions were mirror images (or very close) to rides in other Disney parks. Although they are branching out with the Iron Man Experience (think Star Tours with Iron Man) and the new Ant Man and Wasp attraction (which was not yet open when we went in February 2019.) Mystic Manor is HK's answer to the Haunted Mansion. It has a compelling story with a character (Albert the monkey) that draws you in and it has great effects. HK DL is almost worth it just for this one attraction, we rode it twice.

As to for the mascots, finally saw them at the end of our day and only in the    town    part.Costumes were ruined by staff wearing black running shoes. OK they are on their feet and need to be comfortable but it was seriously jarring. Staff get a 2 10.Things like the recycling bin being loaded and taken away to be emptied but not one put in to replace. Tables not being cleared.Two of the restaurants were shut, a number of the rides were closed, the castle was shut.At HK$620 it was not worth the money. I was told Disneyland HK was loosing money and I am not surprised.We went on a number of rides and they all had positives. Loved the Ironman ride, Starwars and the roller coaster in the Gulch.",Disneyland_HongKong
655933981,4,2019-2,India,"If this is your first disneyland, you will love it. I visited other disney land as well, i found this one smaller as compared to others. Though, it still will give you a delightful experience. The rides are lesser but there's lots to do. IF you come first thing in morning, you will be occupied for the whole day.The biggest attraction is the Parade and don't miss the last parade in night   feast for your eyes. My family and my kid enjoyed it thoroughly",Disneyland_HongKong
655891314,5,2019-1,New Zealand,"HK Disney is the smallest of the Disney Parks and definitely something you can cover in a day. We contemplates doing a VIP tour as we had done in WDW, but left it too late to book and in the end glad that I didn't waste my money here as it just wasn't needed unless you were to go on one of the Chinese holidays.We stayed in HK central and took the train out which was easy to do with them running every few minutes, it really didn't matter if you missed one. Even the return at night despite all the people it was frequent enough that there was never a significant wait. The People are somewhat pushy though it's some form of FOMO(fear or missing out). The train doors open people push in and out. If you finish one ride it seems you need to run to the next one so you can get ahead of 2 people. Rope drop which would normally allow a flow of people into the park was more like the starting gun of the New York Marathon.That said, we loved the park. Favorite ride is Phantom Manor, similar type of ride to Ratatouille in France but with some magical effects. The light show at night is also worth staying to check out.As a tall person 6' 4  I did find myself having to contort myself into seats to fit my legs in. Same thing with Tokyo, but you can fit. I found crossing my legs and moving my feet as far back in the seat as I could before sitting down made a difference.The Lion King show was amazing so I would put that down as a must!",Disneyland_HongKong
655849465,3,2019-2,United Kingdom,"I   m a big Disney fan so was super excited to visit HK Disneyland. Although we had a fun day.. I can   t help but feel disappointed. The park was very small and I feel the price is extortionate when comparing it to Disneyland Paris   which is much larger and significantly cheaper. I found that it didn   t have the magic of Disney and it just felt like any old theme park. The staff were not particularly friendly and they didn   t engage with guests at all   in fact, I was ignored by a group of 3 staff members! Having said this.. mystic manor is quite possibly my new favourite Disney ride ever   you really have to go on it!! ",Disneyland_HongKong

We thought that the park will be packed since is the holiday season but luckily the park is moderately packed.My thought about this place is a great place to spend your day in your HK trip. The park is very nice and it was smaller than your typical Disney park. Compared to other Disney park I've ever visited, this theme park has shortest waiting time especially for thrill seeker attraction and of course no need to check all the fast pass.You can download the apps beforehand to check the schedule for the parade, map, and waiting time for each attraction. Unfortunately in our visit, the Sleeping Beauty castle is still under construction but we managed to enjoy Disney Christmas Celebration.In our visit, We managed to enjoy 6 rides, 1 parade, 2 shows in our 4 hours of visit. If You're a thrill seeker, don't forget to enjoy the two attractions exclusive in HK Disneyland, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars and Mystic Manor. For a magical time of great fun, you can   t go wrong with Hong Kong Disneyland!",Disneyland_HongKong
655346617,5,2019-2,Hong Kong,Great day out and it is so easy to do it in one day as it is so much smaller then other Disneyland around the world. Just be warned that currently the 8pm fireworks aren't on due to maintenance on the castle,Disneyland_HongKong

Crowds were OK for mid week and winter. Cost HK619 for the day each adult. We ate in the explorers club restaurant and had an Asian curry which was OK although a bit bland to cater for all tastes. All in all e all had a fantastic day out. ,Disneyland_HongKong

654876699,4,2019-2,United States,"I personally haven't gone to a Disneyland outside of California so I didnt know what to expect. The cultural ties to the Chinese culture that they implemented at the park was simply amazing. This is probably the only park where Mickey can speak Cantonese. The park is very clean, it was smaller than your typical Disney park. There are various shows you can watch throughout the park. The rides are similar to what you would find in California. I believe the Iron Man attraction might be unique to HK. The park was busy but not to the point where we had to wait hours for a ride. It averaged 30 minutes or so per ride. If you're looking to experience something different from Disney, this would be the place to go. We only went for the day and was able to go on everything we wanted to go on. Just keep in mind that this park is smaller. I would not recommend coming here during Chinese New Year or Golden Week.",Disneyland_HongKong
654875575,4,2018-12,United Kingdom,"First time I've been to Disneyland, so I have no benchmark for comparison. Smaller than I expected, but big enough to fill a full day for two adults.

The Disney train was very cool, and had a real air of excitement...Join Mickey and Minnie for the day and enjoy :)",Disneyland_HongKong
654750950,5,2019-2,United States,"I   ve visited every Disney park except Shanghai and this is perhaps my favorite for a toddler. It   s a close replica of the Anaheim Disneyland but smaller without some of the big kid rides. PROs:1) For a Disney park, it   s not very crowded. I love Tokyo Disney Sea but the crowds really kill the experience there. People in Hong Kong apparently do not wake up early even when the park opens at 930am. There   s really are no lines for the first couple hours. Even during the busiest hours, the lines are moderate. 2) I love the variety of foods from all different regions. I actually looked forward to meals. 3) When we were there, they were 6 different times for the Jedi training and it was never full. 4) Admission tickets are so much cheaper than any other Disney park in the world. You can use apps like Klook to buy discount tickets and discount meals. If your children are under 7, this really is the perfect Disney experience. ",Disneyland_HongKong
654630865,3,2018-3,Australia,There is some wonderful excitement built on the train ride to Disneyland with the cute Mickey themed carriage.

The lines were a bit too long and a lot of people. During the parade, the Disney employees who were in charge to keep the crowd away from the floats were cranky and ill mannered. Disneyland is really a beautiful place. There were restaurants and food carts at every corner. The restrooms were all big and clean.

I personally think the entry ticket is quite pricey, but it's all paid off with incredible attractions. It's truly magical! If you are family with kids, it's a must visit place, you can meet almost all Disney characters, and don't forget to capture your moments, there are so many beautiful photo spot to be captured. Suggestion: you'd better come in the morning, since the weather is not too hot and there will be more crowded in the afternoon. And if you are not in rush, be sure to see the parade or the fireworks show in the night (about 30 minutes before the closing time), that's really worth the wait, and I can say that's one of the best show I have ever seen.",Disneyland_HongKong

As you   d expect lots of Disney themed stuff going on, the train with Mickey shaped windows, hanging hand grips Mickey shaped, various statues of characters in the carafes. We went in February on a damp day. Not overly busy, with queue times between 0 and 10 minutes without any kind of priority boarding ticket. Having been to Disney Land Paris and Walt Disney World in Florida I was still hugely impressed and couldn   t stop smiling for the whole visit. A real mixture of East and West themes going on, similar in so many ways but different enough to make it still feel new. There was some building work going on around the castle and as a result the train wasn   t working though that didn   t detract from the day. Log in to the Disney Land Wi Fi and we got a HK$10 voucher. Thoroughly enjoyed Toy Story Land. The classic area of Tomorrow Land rebranded as Star Wars & Marvel.

I highly recommend the Lion King Festival (at least I think that   s the title of the show) as the music and dance is spectacular for anyone who enjoys enjoyed the movie.

651604695,5,2019-1,Australia,"Sure, after Anaheim, this park is small. But so much fun. We travelled with our 3 year old and it was perfect for him. We enjoyed 3 days in the park. You can't quite see everything in 1 day   2 is perfect and 3 just gave us the luxury of time to see everything with time to spare. We were blown away by the shows   Mickey and the Wonderous Book and The Lion King are incredible. Skip Moana if you are on a schedule. Rides aren't that thrilling, but definitely good fun. Disney has this amazing knack for making kids rides that are fun for adults too! Toy Story Land's parachute drop is the best!! Make sure you get there at rope drop to maximise your time in the park. Food is expensive, but good enough. Choose week days for low crowds   we were there 2nd week of Jan and crowds were good. Take the train (MTR)   it's part of the experience and easy to do with some planning. Saved money by buying tickets on klook   easy to use. Often can get a discount vouchers for shops on main street between 10 and 10.30 while waiting for rope drop for rest of park. They can store your parcels and collect at end of day.Consider booking a character meal (e.g. breakfast at Disney hotel) to get those great character snaps  saves you needing to line up during that precious park time!",Disneyland_HongKong

We dropped off our luggage right before the entrance to Disneyland for a reasonable fee there is a special place at Disney to hold your luggage for the day. Small Disneyland compared to Anaheim and Florida but definitely fun to see and experience. The food inside the park was disappointing.

We had pre purchased tickets   and be aware that there is a great senior discount!This was my first Disneyland in Asia, and my understanding is that Tokyo Disneyland is better. Disneyland HK is smaller than the two parks in the US. It was oddly similar, and yet oddly different. The park was clean. Small World was being refurbished when we were there, so we were not able to check it out. Some fun things to note:1. They have Star Wars chopsticks in the Star Wars shop! Wish I'd bought more. 2. We had Indian food for lunch, and it was spicy but good.3. They had the usual Disney signs with rules before you get on a ride, but I don't recall seeing  You should be sober  as part of the instructions in Anaheim or Orlando!

650641639,4,2019-1,United States,"I've gone to both Disney parks in California and Orlando and while HK Disneyland is very small in comparison, I loved how this park won't have you exhausted by the end of the day and still allow for other activities after you've finished your time. This was how I scheduled my time with my friend. 11 am met a friend at Nam Cheong MTR and rode over to the Disneyland Line. A smart thing to do would be to buy your tickets on your phone as you are riding the MTR. (We didn't and wasted some time at the ticket gate)Once we were in we took our rounds of pictures. The first impression was,  Wow, that's the castle? How awful.  Though when I was there they blocked off the castle so they will be making a more robust castle soon from what I'm understanding.In other parks like Japan and the USA, it's all about looking for the snacks all around the park. (Here's looking at you Dole Whip) I need to get this out of the way, the food is awful at HK Disney. This fact really surprised me given that there's so much good food in HK but it really was pretty horrid. Friend and I had some bad lunch and then went along to other rides. Most rides were about a 20 minute wait which I thought was very acceptable. I think the longest wait we had was for Hyperspace Mountain and that was for 40 minutes.Checked out the parade and was actually hoping for Asian women dressed up as Cinderella or Snow White. Nope. God forbid Snow White is an Asian. But I suppose I get it. lolAfter some snack fails and a Philharmagic 3D show we exited the park at around 6 pm. Took the MTR straight to Tsim Sha Tsui for a nice dinner at 7 pm. At 9 pm, friends and I were parked at a whisky bar and then by 11:30 pm I was home in bed.It was one of the most amazing days because this type of Disney excursion never happens in either California or Florida simply give the scale of the parks and also how awful public transportation is in either cities.I wouldn't recommend coming to HK for Disneyland, that would be a let down.

She had an absolute blast and probably loved the parade best because she got to see all the princesses.Unbeknownst to us we were in Hong Kong the week leading up to Chinese New Year so the city was packed but it didn   t really affect our Disney trip in any way other than it was probably much busier for a Monday than it normally would be.Disneyland Hong Kong is now where near as big as the original or Disney World Orlando, we haven   t yet been to Paris or Tokyo Disney   s so we can   t compare to them. Even though the park isn   t as big as the two in America it   s not missing anything for our 3 year old but it would be lacking in rides and activities for older kids to teens. The classics are there such as It   s a Small World. All in all it was a great trip.",Disneyland_HongKong
650466595,4,2019-1,United Arab Emirates,"We were lucky because the weather wasn't great when we went which meant it was quiet and we didn't wait for any rides.

Character encounters take place at all times throughout the day and all over the park, often without a crazy lineup. The separate sections of the park are unique and well organized, and each gift shop as something a little different from the others. The Lion King show is amazing and very entertaining.

When we went back to one of the stores to check if we dropped it there while paying for merchandise the store lady was very rude. She rudely asked bow do we know it's your even if we find it. I asked her how many other people have come looking for their food vouchers, she said none. I couldn't believe how crass these people were. We requested the reception to reprint the voucher since they had bar code and they refused saying they can't. This just shows how backward their technology is. It's not a big deal to reprint the same bar code. If someone had already used our voucher the bar code wouldn't work anyway so no harm in reprinting it.We were there during the Christmas holidays. It was crowded but well organised. Some of the places were closed since they are expanding. The parade was fun and so we're the ride especially star wars and the grizzly gulch.",Disneyland_HongKong

Not even close.The only postive was taking the    train    around the outskirts which told us there wasn   t much to see, less enjoy. Rides were for 10 12yo and under and their parents carers.

When we went in late April it was very hot and we ended up buying a umbrella which was brilliant for the day. Sadly the castle wasn't open when we were there and surrounded by wire fencing which made photos hard.

647822351,1,2018-10,Canada,"I'm writing an honest and truthful opinion of this park. I'm not paid by anybody to discredit Disney. If you in HK, do not go to this rip off expensive overpriced park, which is not even worth HK$10 let alone paying over HK$400. There's no attraction, the rides are garbage, no decent food court and the price of the food is three to four time the price. this theme park is just as big as the Victoria Park in HK.Those who are commenting about how wonderful the time they had must have been paid by Disney or high with something. I would rather go to Ocean park which is much bigger and more things to see and do.Just to get to Disneyland you are paying US$ 15 20.",Disneyland_HongKong

647569763,4,2018-2,United Arab Emirates,"I visited this superb amusement and theme park two times already. On this last visit , I took my 86 yr old father with me. He enjoyed like a child. The whole area is divided into 7 zones and each of the zones is uniquely planned and designed with the speciality of that zone in mind. Each zone has a ride, a show , an eatery for that area. I loved the Grizzly bears mining area with that stupendous ride!! The zone is planned with hot water geizers and rocky mountainous type. Excellent. Also the space ride area was too good. Starwars themed people were going around. The ride was great. I also liked the Little children's boat rides. The shows were a little less exciting for us. Because it's really for the small kids. There is a nice rail line around the park for easy travel. We bought the online tickets from the website. That made the enty super easy. Also I had the priority pass for us  that's free, my father had the senior ticket very cheap. The passes really helped us to see everything fast. U need to walk around a lot. But lots of resting places and refreshments are available to take it slow. Protect your head with hats.One day finishes like a sweet dream. Interested people can take the two day ticket if so inclined. There is also a hotel inside which can be included in the package. At designated times there are themed festivities, procession and fireworks which attracts lot of crowds. The journey from the city takes around 1 hr. Discounted tickets are available from klook dot com also. Overall, a lifetime dream came true for me. I have been dreaming of going to disneyland from the last 40 yrs minimum. I am very happy.

(Frankly, the queue is scary; unless you go first thing in the morning, or buy  get the fastpass, 1 day is not enough to see ALL the shows  rides... ) Ok, certain things are under renovation   including the well loved Castle, and thus the fireworks at night though never stay that late.Stay for the new Mona show, Lion King show, the favorite Small World ride, the Pooh ride, ...and of course the well loved parade.As usual, magical at least for me to see Mickey and most of the Disney characters.",Disneyland_HongKong

647328225,1,2019-1,Australia,"Visited from Australia. Enjoyed the rides, parades and shows. Disappointed the toy train ride was closed. Knew the castle would be under renovation. The biggest let down was that as we were leaving, we decided to pop by the gift shop to buy a Mickey and Mini Mouse plush toy (in the Chinese outfits) which was under the sign that said 2 for HKD298. When we went to pay, the girl behind the counter said it was HKD168 each. We took her colleague to show her the offer sign and she said it didn   t apply for Mickey and Mini, but that it was for other plush toys (Duffy and friends toys only). The girl was very condescending and made us feel unpleasant. So we accepted and bought it for HKD336. When we left to Hong Kong airport 2 days later, at the Disney store in the airport (we didn   t know there would be one there) we saw the same deal: 2 plush for HKD298 and we asked if it applied to the same Mickey and Mini mouse, and lo and behold the girl at that store said it did! that is, 2 for HKD298!! So how is it that at Disneyland park the store did not honour the offer when the other store did? We were very disappointed that the staff were very rude when we tried to enquire about the offer that was rightly given to everyone at the airport store, but did not give us this offer when it was clearly stated on the stand in the main Disneyland?!? This made what would have been a great day at Disneyland very unpleasant. We have discouraged our family & friends to visit Hong Kong Disneyland due to this unpleasant experience. Disney, we would like you to be more honest in your promotions and to honour what is stated in your pricing. ",Disneyland_HongKong

647135021,5,2019-1,Canada,What else could I possibly say about going to Disneyland that hasn't already been said. A truly magical place. A bit different from the original Disney California. Space Mountain is a combination of Space Mountain and Star Wars. Quite hysterical Hearing R2 D2in your ear while riding in the dark. The haunted house is a combination of Raiders of the Lost Ark style seating and has some of the facts of the haunted house. The jungle cruise is way better then California Disney. The whole Adventure Land is very green and Lush. The Toy Story Land is incredible. Full of lots of great rides. The Thunder Mountain is amazing and much better than California.

We used these for the popular attractions and we lined up basically for 1 2 mins before walking onto a ride.Highlights: grizzly gulch mine car ride, iron man experience and hyperspace mountain.Favourite show: Mickey and wonderous book.Favourite parade: paint the night.Characters: in two days we saw about 15 characters. They seemed to be easier to access than California. They also interacted better. Overall: 1 day is enough for regular travellers. Disney freaks will need 2 days to see everything. We did 2 days and went on major attractions 3 4 times and just took our time. It was much less stressful than California! The castle is getting renovated and will be completed I believe next year.

Plenty of people speak English at least enough to point you in the right direction. Rides were great, food selection is extensive and night activities are well done. It is a long subway ride from Hong Kong then a pretty long walk to front gate. IMPORTANT TIP do not take in any kinds of bags or purses. Put whatever you need in your pockets.

The downside is the quality and price of the food offered in the restaurants and hotels. There is really no other option unless one takes the subway off site It is also hard to find a willingness in the employees to accommodate special diets such as gluten free. Our granddaughter has celiacs and we asked for ice cream in a dish rather than a cone. You would think we had asked for something unbelievably difficult for them to do. They would only give us the ice cream in a cardboard paper french fry container and not in a plastic cup that they used to serve sundaes in. We found this same reluctance to make exceptions when ordering in all of the restaurants there. It was surprising to find this at a place with the Disney brand, especially considering their prices for food. The actual park tickets and hotel tickets were reasonable.",Disneyland_HongKong

646216848,5,2018-12,Mauritius,"Being an adult and my first visit to DisneyLand, the experience was awesome. My kids were so happy to see all their favorite Disney figures. Try buying your tickets online to avoid 30 45 minutes queue even on weekdays and be early at the entrance to make most of the attractions since waiting time for attractions were 30 45 mins waiting time. A one day ticket will be enough if you are early. Look for a taxi to get to DisneyLand, they are way cheaper than UBER and off from there by 17:00 since it gets very cold around 8 9 Degrees Celsius in December",Disneyland_HongKong

The toy story land was a winner with the kids (especially the hot wheels and soldier rides!) and they also loved the Main Street. The food isn   t great, but we didn   t expect it to be!

645245762,5,2019-1,United Kingdom,"My husband and I had a long layover at the airport, so we left our bags at the Left Luggage counter in Terminal 2 and caught a blue taxi to Disneyland. I   ve visited both Disney parks in the States many times, so I was excited to see the similarities and differences at the Hong Kong park.We arrived around 2:30 pm, and there was absolutely no queue. The ticket counter employee kindly informed us that there was no need to purchase fast pass tickets given the small number of guests at the park that day. And she was right! The longest queue was for 25 minutes for Winnie the Pooh. Otherwise, we walked right on to rides or waited 5   10 minutes. I have never seen a Disney park less crowded (we visited on January 9th).Like all Disneys, the park is charming and well done. There is a LOT of construction right now, including the castle and construction in Tomorrowland. There is a strong focus on photographs   so many character meet and greets and photo opportunities everywhere. Perhaps this is due to the new Instagram focused world we live in. It was fascinating to see so many dressed up guests ready for their pictures   high heels, designer dresses, lipstick, etc. This is not your normal turkey leg eating guest at the Florida park. :)The park appears to be quite small compared to CA Disneyland. We spent about 3.5 hours at the park and we were ready to go (we only rode the majority of the rides once). The roller coasters were a bit more exciting than those in the States   Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (which looks like Thunder Mountain Railroad) is much more exciting. It was also interesting to see the similarities and differences between Mystic Manor and the Haunted Mansion. There were also a few new rides and experiences that I hadn   t seen in the States.I   m glad we didn   t take a full day out of our initial visit to Hong Kong to visit Disney, but it was the perfect place to spend a long layover.

645088792,5,2019-1,Australia,"Smaller and with much less    challenging    rides than Ocean Park, HK Disneyland nevertheless really delivers.We went to HKDL only a couple of days after OP and thought it might be theme park overkill, but easily managed to keep going from before opening (we arrived 15    prior to 10.30am start) until closing after the final street parade. The family, including 17, 20 and 22 year olds, each had an awesome time. The lines were short (a Thursday in January), the weather perfectly in the Goldilocks zone, the rides fun albeit not too much of a challenge, and the vibe was ideal (how can you not get into it when fully 10 20% of the adult guests are wearing Mickey  Minnie ears or other HKDL headgear?!). I can even recommend forking out slightly extra in buying the combo food package (something I normally eschew), and definitely suggest it   s well worth purchasing online prior to going. If you can only go to one park I   d suggest HKDL on balance (cleaner, easier, fewer queues and less walking), unless you   re after more of a    local    flavour or want more thrill seeking rides. Ideally do both and make your own comparisons. Either way, enjoy the ride!",Disneyland_HongKong

It   s easy to get to (take the train from HK central to Sunny Bay, on the Tung Chung line, then change at Sunny Bay, then the purpose built Disneyland line (Mickey theming literally everywhere!) to the resort. It   s around 600$HK which is around   60 or US$75 for a one day pass, and one day is really all you need. (They do sting you a little on the locker charges though). It has all the Disney touches you   d expect at a Disney park, but it   s very small and compact. I was lucky that the day I visited crowds were low. I never queued more than 10min for anything. Hyperspace Mountain and the Iron Man ride were great, Tomorrowland is probably the best for adult guests. The mine train in Grizzly Gulch is great too. Mystic Manor will seem strange if you   re used to the Haunted Mansion, but it has its own charm. Almost everything is kid friendly and Fantasyland seems to take up a larger proportion of the park than in Florida or California. It was so quiet that some food outlets were closed, but the Skyliner Diner, Explorers and Banquet Hall had good choices and plenty of seating",Disneyland_HongKong

The castle was closed off for refurbishment, so no nice pics of the castle or sounding area, the castle is also only half the size of other disney resorts. The Mickey light show in main street was excellent and very well done but sadly the night show that we waited for was cancelled 2 mins before it was due to start because of about 3mins of a VERY light rain shower. We have visited Florida Disney many times and it is obviously far superior but the main comment I have to say is that every single staff member at Hong Kong looked miserable and that they didn't really want to be there, by comparison Florida staff are bursting with smiles and fun. Not many large rides here and only two fast pass rides. We ate at the Chinese restaurant which was just average food. I would definitely recommend a visit and for those that can 't compare to other Disney parks you'll have a great day out.",Disneyland_HongKong

We booked our tickets online through Klook, which proved effortless as we showed our QR codes to gain enterance and off we went. We were inside the main enterance just after gate opening. We had been to Disneyland California and roughly knew the rides we wanted to get on, so headed straight for them. We rode quite a few of the rides with little to no waiting time and made our way around the park easily picking rides depending on wait time. We only had the 1 day, so if you do too, I suggest you wear comfortable shoes. Yes, it   s a smaller park but there   s still kilometers to walk.

Highly recommend the Grizzly Mine Car and Hyperspace rides. We also watched a few shows and parades. The Lion King show was particular magical, really brings back the kid in us.

Some rides opened early while others opened a little later. The castle was under construction, so that isn't a good picture right now. We did the Ironman ride which was very fun and there was no line at all. It seems that since Shanghai Disney opened it isn't as crowded at Hong Kong Disney. We did all the big rides that we wanted to do and funny enough the longest line was for Jungle Cruise. Haha! Our new favorite ride is Mystic Manor, a new and terrific version of Haunted Mansion. It is really well done! Be sure you see it! We loved the park! We made a reservation at Crystal Lotus but didn't have a cute dim sum reservation so we were not able to get that. I wrote a separate review on that restaurant. We had done the whole park and shopped by 1 pm. As we headed out to go to the Disneyland Hotel around 1pm, the crowds coming in were insane! Apparently everyone arrives late and stays late. So we were very happy to come early and leave early. Happy that we went, and enjoyed it! We got discount tickets from Klook.com in advance.

No lines to buy tickets to get into the park and super quick to walk over to the rides. We were there on a Thursday in January and we didn   t have any lines longer than 5 minutes until around noon. We also got a fast pass for Hyper Space Mountain in the morning to be sure we could come back again later without waiting. I would also recommend downloading the Hong Kong Disneyland app to see wait times and get a map of the park. We ate at the Main Street Corner cafe and the sweet and sour chicken and shrimp and the burgers were really good.

The Mystic Manor ride was good but the queue was abysmal, and not very clearly signposted. The riverboat ride was fantastic, largely because of the guide who deserves either an Oscar or a pay rise for her brilliant commentary. The Runaway Mine Carts ride was extremely good fun, and very well done in terms of safety. Most queues moved surprisingly quickly, and it was all relatively painless, even for a Disney cynic like me.

A couple of them just came out a few minutes for picture shoots and headed back in. The on line videos showed Disney characters just walking around the park, interacting with people, making the ambiance of the park more Disney like. This was actually the expectation.

My six year old went on every ride (apart from RC Racer due to height) and apart from Mystic Manor (which he found a little scary), he loved them all. The look of delight in my three year old   s face was also sweet. It was a fantastic warmer for the bigger parks in the U.S.A. One day park? Definitely not. We did every single ride (apart from RC Racer and Tarzan   s House) and every single show (apart from Moana) and parades, net characters, did none of the gardens and we just fit it into two days. And we were there from open to close with a stack of fast passes in hand. Maybe we were slowed down due to having little kids with us but I don   t know how people do the park in one day and do it justice. Where the park lost a star was the food and merchandise. The food was gross. That   s all I can say about that. The merchandise? Well unfortunately there were heaps of shops on Main Street but they all stocked exactly the same merchandise. Apart from Pandora which I don   t personally wear, there was nothing for adults. The variety just wasn   t there and the selection that was there was poor. Would I go back?

But for us, Disneyland was the happiest place on earth that day.It is expensive, yes, but just make the most of it and laugh along with all the others who are there for the day. Remember, if you are 65 and over, there is a huge discount! Normal entry fee is HKD615 and over 65 is HKD100. You can't purchase senior tickets online and have to do it when you are there. Many said that the officials don't ask for proof of age when you purchase this ticket, but they did ask us. So make sure you have this with you!Great day, thoroughly enjoyed it!!",Disneyland_HongKong
642585839,4,2018-1,Australia,We were here at a busy time of year so there were long queues for most rides and limited express passes but it's disneyland so still well worth a visit. They have WiFi but it's very patchy. It's expensive as you would expect but the kids loved it. ,Disneyland_HongKong
642556031,5,2018-12,Hong Kong,I   ve been to LA   this one is good too. But wait times and crowd can get to you. Getting a Two day pass helps if you have kids on tow.,Disneyland_HongKong
642538330,3,2018-12,Philippines,"Compare it to universal studios, Disneyland hongkong is overrated! 1. Tickets are Expensive because half of the theme park is under renovation! 2. Food is way too expensive for a no quality product. They should have at least upgrade the taste, serving and of course presentation. 3. Photo ops with mascots is 15 minutes only. They should have additional time or Atleast post the timeline in a map direction for visitor   s reference! 4. Sellers here are rude! They will not give you unless you pay first, (as if you   re not going to pay if you order duh ) 5. Good for kids who don   t like extreme rides. 6. Picture in maze imposed limited time also. We recommend for children but not with teens who enjoy extreme rides! 7. Food and drinks from outside is prohibited. Again, as if the food here is awesomely tasteful! It   s really a waste of money to eat here. NO QUALITY!!!!! But rather pricy.",Disneyland_HongKong
642534419,2,2018-12,Singapore,Our two day visit to Disneyland was a bitter disappointment. The park was so busy you could not move around freely. The average wait time for each ride was 60 minutes. There is no option of a fast pass as is the norm in many other theme parks around the world. We did not see the Disney Princesses for a photo opportunity (which was the only reason my youngest two wanted to go to Disneyland) and all the other photo opportunities were full before we even arrived at the destination. The train around the park only went one way and did not return to its point of departure. The lines for coffee and food resulted in is leaving the park earlier than we anticipated because the wait was too long. A very disappointing experience to say the least and we will not be back! Please do not visit during the Christmas New Year season!,Disneyland_HongKong

641925696,5,2018-11,Singapore,Disneyland is every child dream place but it is always super crowded. This disneyland on the other hand ain't that crowded! YAY! We went early in the morning. The morning crowd is manageable. We manage to get to go twice on some rides. Did not wait more than 30mins at any rides. Easy to walk around. Christmas lightings were up. We saw the parade and it was fun. Snacks stores everywhere. Many shows to watch. Very well organised place. Go on weekdays and it will be great! I went on Friday and it is not that crowded.,Disneyland_HongKong
641894325,5,2018-12,Hong Kong,"Disney land is great for fun and stuff but 3 years ago, there were rides like the Buzz Lightyear based shooting and Utopia. They were quite popular rides but Disney has taken them away and replaced them with rides like Iron Man Experience. Of course, these rides are quite good but what about the old ones? They were good too. Also, the castle is currently under construction and the food is quite expensive",Disneyland_HongKong

641689804,5,2018-12,Malaysia,"First time here in Hong Kong Disneyland... my kids had lots of fun here especially the Mystic Manor and the Toy Story Parachute Ride... The place is huge but because it is too pack during the time we go, so we wasted lots of time is queing for rides and even for foods. There lots of stuffs in there   they evenhave Starwars and Ironman ride in there... my kids loved it... Met Mickey & Minie, Goofy, Chipmunks, Donald Duck and Ironman too... ",Disneyland_HongKong
641689558,5,2018-12,Philippines,"Went to HK Disneyland last 17th December 2018 with my wife and 3.5 year old son. Even if it   s not our first time anymore, that magical happy feeling is still palpable.We arrived 10:30AM and as expected, we inevitably spent too much time in the first area around Main Street with so much to do and see, before realizing we had to move on to the other areas and attactions. My son particiularly loved the Toy Story Land area, given his familiarity with the characters there, we even went back there at night for a second time upon his request. We also spent more than an hour lining up to have a picture with Micky Mouse, but the long wait was worth it (had an easier time lining up for Chewbacca & R2D2 earlier).We had lunch and dinner at the Royal Banquet and Explorers Club, respectively. These venues offer great food and are good choices in maximizing your Klook meal coupon (HKD 149 per meal and you just pay the excess if any, plus a free ice cream or popcorn). As usual, lining up for rides was a bit of a challenge, but got easier towards the afternoon, so we just chose the ones that were suitable for our son. We took a lot of great photos all around the park and realized in hindsight that we should have gotten the 2 day pass instead of 1 day to maximize; perhaps we   ll do it next time when our son is older.By 9PM, the Parade of Disneyland characters got underway and my son, no matter how sleepy, perked up especially when he saw Lighning McQueen and Big Mack! It was an eye catching moving light show by all the performers who really looked good glowing in the dark with their LED suits and mobile stages. Then after the Parade, we went to the shops for souvenirs before we finally went back to the hotel via MTR (which fortunately operates until before midnight).Our recommendations: 1. If you really expect to spend the whole day at the park, best to avail of the Klook park entry tickets with meals for savings.2. If your overall HK itinerary can accomodate, consider the 2 day pass instead of 1 day if you really want to maximize all the attractions there without rushing so much (your kids will surely enjoy). Downloading the theme park application will also greatly help because you can conveniently see all the shows and at what time. 3. We suggest also that you print the Klook park entry tickets if possible so that it is easy to present it at the gate because trying to open the e coupons from one   s mobile phone can get confusing and will delay the queue (like what happened in our case). (Using the said e coupons, they will print out the official coupons at the gate which you will use to claim your meals snacks later on.)Hope this review helps!",Disneyland_HongKong
641687100,5,2018-12,Philippines,"I love the attention to design and detail here, along with all the basic great things that happen here   had a great day seeing things and experiencing many rides. Over time I am thinking they should add another park here. This is a solid one day adventure, and two days if you incorporate some rest   I think staying at the Disney hotels would be very good for that. Having come here from California, and been to the Anaheim Disneyland several times, this might somewhat pale in comparison, but still a fun experience. Also great people watching, especially for a westerner. Snowfall at the Christmas tree was fantastic, and I still love It's a Small, Small World!",Disneyland_HongKong

Very hot4. Very noisy5. Plenty of long walksPrepare your wallet, prepare your stamina, prepare for the crowd.The Iron Man experience was the best so far. The small world ride and show was just too much.

The year end season provides both the climate and the atmosphere for christmas themed shows and celebrations taking place in the park though the day. It's a great place for children with various rides shows eateries which are family and child friendly. My only tip is to try and go on a weekday as the crowds in the weekend are understood to be really massive. I was there on a Monday in december and the crowd was sizeable with waits for rides going up to 30 minutes for the more popular ones. My thoughts are that a 1 day visit is sufficient unless you intend to go for all the rides shows and you have children with you.,Disneyland_HongKong
639080102,5,2018-2,Hong Kong,"A pain. Over expensive. Over cheesy, touristic rip off in one centre. Felt like my entire life   s savings were being squeezed out of me. Ok for the kids but even they got bored of stuff too quickly. Needs rethinking",Disneyland_HongKong

Apart from the rather small Sleeping Beauty Castle being under renovation, what stood out were how small the park was and expensive food. As it was not yet peak visitation and helped by slightly rainy weather (which also ruined some outdoor shows and parades), we managed to cover all the rides and shows we wanted in a day. Of all the attractions, we liked The Festival of the Lion King, Mickey and the Wonderous Book, Iron Man Experience and Mickey   s Philharmagic.",Disneyland_HongKong

638511615,2,2018-11,Philippines,"When we arrived there the castle was closed and some other rides were not operating, but still had to pay full price. We ate a meal there and it was absolutely tasteless, in fact the worst meal i have had for years.We ordered Shabu Shabu from the Japanese outlet. I wanted to order fish & chips from somewhere near the goldmine but the restaurant was closed.Corn on the cob about US$6, ice cream terribly expensive. My wife enjoyed visiting Disneyland, seeing a couple of parades, a couple of shows and many photos but it would have been more enjoyable if we had children. BUT i am sure it would have cost a lot more because they would be wanting ice cream, toys, pop corn drinks etc and i would not have been prepared to pay these ridiculous prices.",Disneyland_HongKong

638478152,5,2018-10,India,"Disneyland is made basically for children but it   s really amazing for adults too. we were there in first few of October and it was not so busy time there, still 2 days are not sufficient to enjoy the whole Disneyland. We enjoyed there every second of the time we spent there. Not only your children, you will not like to come back from Disneyland. Everything is made there is to mesmerise you. Starting from the toy train to meeting the ICONIC Mickey mouse. You can   t forget a single second of your time spent here.Disneyland is divided in 7 sections. In which only two sections have rides, in which fantasyland is for young children and tomorrowland is for adults and teens.Other than rides, you will see, ironman museum with an awesome 7D show. Another 7D show is about Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.   it   s an small world    ride in a boat is simply the most charming. Well I will not say much about other attractions, but all are equally awesome. Park is super clean and well maintained. You won   t find anything which looked dirty or worn out. Staff is very supportive. When we were there HALLOWEEN was around corners, so the whole park was decorated with Halloween theme. Entry fee has just right price tag but rest everything inside is so costly. A half litre water bottle costed 35 HKD. A mickey shaped lighting balloon costs HKD 150. Logically this balloon should cost less than 15 HKD (150INR) in India. Other than attractions, you can also shop there extensively, from a basic T shirt to a great party wear gown, a simple water bottle to soft toys, everything related to Disney is there for sale. Prices are obviously so high. A basic T shirt for 2 yr child was priced for 200 HKD (2000 INR). A doll set of 24 small dolls set back me 400 HKD(4000INR). I have not visited other Disneylands, but this one is so mesmerising that your brain will refuse to forget the instances of Disneyland. Overall it   s a must visit place if you are in Hong Kong.",Disneyland_HongKong
638438046,4,2018-4,Hong Kong,"As a resident of Hong Kong, and very close to Disneyland, we   ve been visiting here often ever since it opened. We used to have yearly passes for the whole family. It is such an awesome escape from the frantic, sometimes    dirty    city life that surrounds it. All the normal Disney characters can be seen plus a number of new (to Disney)    Marvel    characters and Marvel inspired rides. Favourites of our family include the Jungle River Cruise, Grizzly Gulch, It   s a Small World, TeaCup ride, Slinky Dog and Mystic Manor. The staff are almost always friendly and helpful and the shows and parades are ALWAYS jaw dropping and definitely not to be missed. Watch out for the sporadic street performances of the street sweeper drummers who have an amazing drum perscusion show based on their garbage bins and cleaning implements. Also watch out for the    cleaner    who paints (using water) Disney characters literally on the street road. There are only really two possible negatives to the Disney experience. A very limited selection of western style (and quality) foods in some of the Disney resteraunts. Lastly, if it   s a mainland China holiday Disney can be quite unpleasant with the crowds. The best plan is to ALWAYS try and get there for opening time for less queues and crowds. Having said that, the iconic fireworks show is well worth hanging around for. Oh, and get there by train. Disney has its own train station. It   s the cleanest, quickest, cheapest way to get there. Have a GREAT trip to Disneyland. I thoroughly recommend it.",Disneyland_HongKong
638437626,4,2018-12,Australia,"i visited here about 15years ago and it was great then. now not so sure. average waiting time was over 60 mins. food was not good. best option was the popcorn. public shows were great in main street, especially the Xmas show.if you go make sure you buy the express pass otherwise you will wait all day for a couple of rides..",Disneyland_HongKong

We were kind of surprised that there was not a wide verity of flavored popcorn's like they have in Japan. ",Disneyland_HongKong
638229418,5,2018-4,Philippines,"One day is not enough to explore the entire Hongkong Disneyland. As a family with a Kiddo it took us two days to roam the entire park. When you enter the park make sure that you have your own Disneyland Map Park with you. This way you can plan your day. Watch out for the time allotted for different shows.The shows were fantastic, the circle of life is even more fantastic.There will be long queue for every show it is an advantage to get a fast pass to escape the long line. Except for picture taking with Minnie and Mickey Mouse you have to endure the long queue because there   s no fast pass for this.The jungle river experience is a must! For water if thirsty there should be water fountain in the park just locate it in the map, anyway selfie stick is not allowed inside the park. ",Disneyland_HongKong

That said we had a great time, we brought a 2 day pass as there was not much difference in price of 1 day before we went, we also purchased the food package of 2 meals and a snack. The food you get with this deal is very filling and we struggled to get through all the food we could have. The snack was either popcorn or an ice cream and the meals were full size dinners with soft drink. Everything that we ate was very tasty.Possibly the 1 meal and a snack option would have suited us better.It was very quiet there when we went and hardly had to queue for the rides and didn   t need to use fast passes at all.decorations for Christmas were really good but I was disappointed that there was not much In the way of Disney Christmas ornaments to purchase.All in all we had a great time, I still can   t get over how small the castle is, I thought the one in Paris was small but it   s huge in comparison to the one here.",Disneyland_HongKong

637934986,3,2018-12,China,"Took my daughter to HK Disneyland for her 5th birthday. Disneyland hotels are hugely overpriced, so we booked a hotel outside Disney. The Park itself is beautiful, so are most of the shows  I loved Magic Manor and my daughter loved the Lion King show. The parade was great, but a bit too short. A few things went bad though  lots of waiting for every ride  15 25  minutes. Kids got tired and we gave up on some rides. The food is overpriced and tasted bad  The Main Dining Hall (up to 20 USD for a tasteless meal), food stalls with outdated corn for 4 USD 4, sausages 5 USD. Actually all soft drinks in the Park cost HKD 32 ( 4  USD) and you are not allowed to bring your own food! Another point  it's close to Christmas time, a lot of Christmas music was being played non stop including Church hymns like Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, O Come All Ye Faithful, etc. Sounds too religious, not suitable for kids, a bight of brainwashing so to say. And no wi fi at the park at all. For the families with young kids I recommend 1 day visit after a heavy breakfast.)",Disneyland_HongKong

There was a lot of old people which was different showing no matter how old you get you can still enjoy Disney. Stayed here all day to watch parade so was worth it. Value for money Highly recommend.

We expected a big crowd, being a Saturday, and true enough, we had to fall in line for rides. We opted for less crowded attractions.In the bumper car area, the grandkid passed the height test but without notice that he had to be at least 8 years old, he was not allowed in. There were few staff members positioned to assist, and we had to get information from vendors manning their kiosks.What made our Disney experience worth it was the amazing parade.

It helped that we bought our tickets online (and cheaper) as we were able to skip the ticket counters and breezed through the entrance. We were greeted by rows of souvenir shops and rows of cheery greeters before the kids raced towards the rides. Us adults appreciated that there is (already) a Starbucks along the Main Ave which provided a caffeine respite every now and then. We appreciate the numerous pockets of benches for rests and very helpful staff who consistently provided assistance to our queries.We loved our photo ops with Cinderella and Snow White as well as the Lion King and Moana shows.",Disneyland_HongKong

Its a very compact park, you can do it all in a day.2. Its easy to get to by taxi or train.3. While the tickets compare in price to Orlando, stuff inside is less expensive (really!).4. The VIP experience is worth it, especially if the park is busy. Be sure to get the armbands for the parade   you get the best seats possible with no jockeying.5.

Thunder Mountain was my absolute favorite ride (for slightly older kids and adults) and the shows were great! We saw the Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book! Both amazing! The Moana show was ok but Moana didn   t sing so we left. Good food options and lots of lands to explore. Definitely smaller than Disney so if you start early you could see most of the park in a day.

636961092,5,2018-12,India,Our visit to Disneyland was planned solely for son who   s 4 year old. That we would also have so much fun was not known The whole environment is one of gala and celebrations. The different worlds created within Disneyland make for one new experience after the other. It is humanly impossible to do all the rides and there is a fair bit of walking in between the different    lands    and quite a wait for the very popular rides. You can you the fast access to plan though. The only downer was the food options. If you are fussy you should plan your movement through Disneyland to be around the restaurant that serves food that you like. The dining options are a bit pricey for the fare offered but that   s come to be expected of all entertainment parks et al. The rides themselves are brilliant. My wife is particular got nostalgic when she did the small world ride again after 15 odd years. The Iron man ride is a do not miss ride. Couple of pieces of advise:A. Plan your route. For eg. come to the Iron man ride in the evening. Nearly no waiting around that time. Plan where you want to have lunch and decide the route for covering the various lands.B. Plan which rides and attractions you want to cover or are must do. C. Get hold of the maps once you enter and the show timings. There are different shows and the timings vary. Also the popular ones go full sometimes 30 mins in advance. D. And finally see the timing of the parades. There a few in the evening. The grand finale at the park closing time is not to be missed. It gets crowded there so try and get there to get a good path side place. Honestly it   s near impossible to cover the park in a single day. Even most good ones would take a day to cover even at a rapid pace. Two days would give you the ability to cover the park in a relaxed manner. Goes without saying a must do. ,Disneyland_HongKong

The park opens later than other Disney parks which worked out for us because we could actually sleep in on vacation. The park is small but absolutely lovely. I found that our only negative was some pushy guests at parade time. There were virtually no lines for most rides. Our hotel gave us fastpasses but we didn   t need a single one. Most rides were actually walk on with no wait at all. We did wait about 20 minutes for Dumbo, I think that   s it. I would have liked to have seen more offerings to meet the characters. Cast Members were friendly but not quite up to the usual Disney standard. Overall, wonderful but small park, easily done in a full day. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Points for improvement:   cleaner and more accessible public toilets   healthier dishes in the menu for children  English as main language in rides and of characters mascots plays We ended up staying in Hotel Disneyland as well where the amenities and rooms were spacious, clean and stayed true to Disney designs.

636822111,4,2018-11,United Kingdom,"We had a lovely full day at Disneyland Hong Kong.We have been to Paris, California and Florida parks and Hong Kong is tiny in comparison but it is a still a fun day if you are in the area.The castle is still there but is partly obscured by construction walls and a crane   it will soon be demolished for a new super castle in 2019 which is really exciting.The park is mostly bilingual with English and Cantonese (and Mandarin on occasions)   we would it hilarious when Mickey and friends spoke in Cantonese.Tips:Highlights of the park that you have to go on   Mystic Manor (a unique experience amongst disney parks with a fusion of ratatouille and haunted mansion rides), Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Train (a fusion of Exhibition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain and a launch coaster), and Hyperspace Mountain (HKDL version of space mountain). We went on each of these twice and loved them. The rest of the park rides are the same similar as the rest of the parks around the world.Mickey and the Wondrous Book is a really special show and I highly recommend you see it. Each performance was full and it wasn't until our third attempt did we get a seat! It's a fusion of Florida's happily ever after night time show and Paris's Peter Pan night time show. The live singing and performers were all excellent.Both parades were excellent and are your opportunity to see lots of characters at once. Arrive 30 minutes before to get your spot.If you want to meet characters get to the park for 9.30am. Gates open at 10 and there are lots of characters to meet on main street USA before the main park opens at 10.30   Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald and Daisy, Chip and Dale were all out and about.Only negatives of our day were the weak side show performances e.g. Moana home coming and the Christmas stage show. I'd avoid these and use the time to go on rides. Also the shops were always rammed and overflowing with queues snaking around the shop so you couldn't find the end of the line. If you want to get gifts and don't want to queue there is a hong kong disney store at the airport with the same prices and a fair bit of stock.",Disneyland_HongKong

I will note that i am a huge disney fan and that this was my first disney part visit.We arrived early and seemed to be at the start of tourist season. It was busy but not too bad. We didnt stand in a line for longer than 20 minutes. When the park opens you are first only allowed in the shopping area, obviously so you can buy stuff and they can make money but there is sooooo much to choose from.We went on most of the rides and went on them twice   once at day and once at night.We bought the tickets and food vouchers on Klook and this was a great savings and also really worth it.The rides were really fun and the overall ride experience was amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed the mine cart in the grizzly grouch area, as well as the star wars ride and the toy story horse shoe.The parades   we watched both the day and night parades   were absolutely spectacular and definitely worth going to   just a tip though is to find a spot about 30 minutes before the parade is due to start as there are alot of people.Also try and find a spot towards the end of main street USA where the road splits to the different parks as the last few floats and characters dont go all the way to the bottom of the road.We also managed to watch two of the shows. The Lion King which was amazing and then Moana which was great but the Lion King was definitely a way better experience.The only let down was that the characters are not walking around so they were only available for short time slots and for a limited amount of people so you had to try and plan your day around this.",Disneyland_HongKong
636478172,5,2018-11,United Kingdom,"Disneyland is a must when you visit Hong Kong, it is located near the airport which is out of the way depending on where you are staying.We were staying the New Territories (Sha Tin), fortunately there is a bus that goes to Lantau Island Plaza where we then change to Disneyland bus (R8) which take us straight to Disneyland, all in all taking around 40 mins to get there.There are many ways to get the Disneyland the MTR, the blue coloured taxis or bus, the bus is definitely the cheaper option costing under $50 HKD per person.Entry to the park is quite expensive costing $699 per adult and $515 per child (as of October 2018) in total costing   210 GBP.Within the park there are many various rides that suits all ages, from the infamous Hyperspace Mountain to the jungle cruise.The eatery within the park are reasonable priced. We visited the park during a weekday and even though there was a lot of people in the park, the queues for rides were very good, averaging around a 10 minute wait.The parade is not to be missed and was very well put together. During our visit in October 2018 there was construction work being carried out on the Princess Castle, so there was no firework display in the evening. Overall, we have a fantastic day and out young children loved their time in Disneyland Hong Kong and it was definitely worth the visit. Tips:Visit during a weekday.Pre book buy tickets to see if there are any deals packages.",Disneyland_HongKong

636209289,4,2018-11,Australia,"Entry was expensive, kids under 2.5 years free. A lot of people told us it wasn   t worth it and it will be crap however we did enjoy it. The kids are young so they rode on rides that suited their age group. Not a huge variety of food but there are a few restaurant cafes around. My only safety concern was lack of security guards or police presence. I caught a man taking pictures of my child along with other kids while watching the Moana live show. He was on his own not accompanied by a child or family. He was taking photos of young teenagers too. I confronted him to delete but he didn   t speak English. Managed to delete but this didn   t stop him doing it again. We spotted him a few times. While waiting for our turn on rides 2 other I saw two native people taking photos of my own children I asked them to stop and intervened but again people don   t speak English. They   d stare like it was completely normal and I   m over reacting. It made me very upset, angry and furious and this behaviour is unacceptable. Especially when it comes to children. When I contacted authorities and staff they didn   t seem to care. This is VERY VERY important that people are made aware and to be on alert.

We have received complimentary ice cream at restuarant and some staff would wish Happy Birthday.However, it is prob my last time gg to Disneyland HK as the 1) Lion King show was the same as 10 yrs ago. 2) experience of being pushed by rude mainland Chinese in queues was not pleasant at all.

Most of the rides in Small World are the same sans Peter Pan. Their rides in some of the areas are different. Food is really bad. Jr Yelper said we should eat at the best restaurant in the part, The Explorer Club with a variety of ethnic selections to order. But at nearly $20 a plate with meager portions, it was the worse Disney park meals I   ve ever had. The Jungle Ride was closed the weekday we went. They had 2 different Disney ice cream pops sold at the carts. One is blueberry and the Minnie is Strawberry for $5 USD. They were OK. The evening light show was basically flashing lights of Mickey and friends on the buildings. The electric parade was really good. We watched part of the Moana show.

Download the App and it tells you the current wait times all over the park.It is much smaller than Disneylands but that was good for us with 2 kids under 7, it was easy to walk around the whole park a few times, and most of the rides were good for the younger kids. It might be lacking if you're after big thrills. The food was generally ok and not at astonishing prices.As it got dark we went back and had a second ride on all the things we wanted and some we had missed earlier in the day. All 3 parades we good and as it wasn't too busy everyone was able to see fine. Highlights: The Lion King show (don't miss this and it's a good airconditioned break), Mystic Manor and the Jungle River cruise (make sure you go after dark, it's much better). As people have mentioned HK Disneyland doesn't really have the characters just walking around the Park like you find in other Disneylands, so if getting pics with them is your thing you will have to line up at specific locations and times. The train out there was good, and wasn't even packed after closing time (we walked slowly back to the station). Easily managed to stay the whole day, opening to close, and would definitely go back next time we are in HK.

We visited in mid November and the park was decorated for Christmas which made it even more special. It was my wife and I and our 20 year old daughter who went. The rides were excellent. The lines were pretty short (we were there on a Monday), the longest we waited was 20 minutes but some rides we just walked on. The shows and parades were pretty good. Except the snow show at 6:15pm. Not worth waiting around for. The park was clean, the toilets were clean, plenty of food stores (overpriced but that goes with the territory)Best rides were Mystic Manor, Grizzly Gulch and the Iron Man one in Tomorrow Land. My daughter said the only negative was that there were no thrill rides like a major roller coaster. Getting there via the MTR was super easy. If you bought the tickets online you have to go to Guest Relations on the left of the main gate to pick up your actual tickets. If this has been helpful please give me a helpful vote.

The only disappointment was the BIG lines to see the characters   and this resulted in us missing out on a photo with most of them! Even with a full 2 days here.. The lines close, well before they even officially arrive, and with only a couple of appearances each day, it is so limited! There should be more characters dressed up, and they should be out & about ALL day   not just an hour here & there... there could be 2 of each scattered throughout the park even.. and this would make everyones visit just that bit more magical!!

The parades started late   so we missed the last few minutes of the evening parade as we had a coach pick up to meet. The parades were not a patch on Paris some 25 years agoThe majority of the staff were rude and unhelpful   unlike the Paris staff.

633163763,4,2018-10,Hong Kong,Need to plan which rides you want to go on and what you want to see as it   s too big to do everything. shows arrive about 15 20min early. rides were max about 30min to 1 hour wait without fast track on a sunday. Hit the ones you want to go first early to beat the crowds. I went for halloween and there was a good 2 for 1 deal on disney   s site that allows me to enter the park a second time before the end of this year. For popular characters expect at least 30 min to 1 hour waits to take pictures with them (eg. jack and sally for halloween). disney staff give out lots of stickers and candy during halloween. the villains night parade at the end is not as exciting as the one during the day or their regular one as the floats with the villains are plain comparatively. ,Disneyland_HongKong

It   s magical right from the beginning with beautiful statues of Mickey Mouse and his friends in a big water fountain. We arrived in the morning as soon as the park was opening and went through the ticket queue fairly fast. But the crowd was growing much quicker than expected, and later on we found out we chose a public holiday weekend so the crowds were much bigger than usual! We would advise to research this before you plan your trip because it definitely tested our patience and dampened our spirits at times. Because of this, the queues for every single ride were anywhere from 30 minutes several hours long, and it was a very hot day. We anticipated having to line up at Disneyland but the public holiday really made things 10 times slower. But when your at Disneyland, not even that can get you down, it   s just so magical and happy! One ride in each    land    had the option for you to scan your ticket and it would give you another ticket with a time frame on it, so you   re able to go and do other things then come back to skip the line within that time frame. We were then able to go on all the main rides and explore each land. There were so many amazingly fun rides to experience, as well as photo meet and greets with favourite Disney characters such as Eeyore, r2d2, iron man and more. Tarzan   s treehouse is just brilliant, toy story land is every big kids dream and we were lucky enough to see Disneyland at Halloween time, which was spectacular! We spent all day there and upon reflection, would   ve planned to spend 2 full days, regardless of the public holiday. Disneyland truly is what you imagine it to be and more!

Most time you will spend at Fantasyland. Here you have maximum number of rides and shows. Also many characters would visit you. Because you have so many things to cover so plan your route accordingly. As we had 2 day pass, we went around in liesure. Lion king show was mind blowing. So was Mickey and the adventure book. we had a great time. The night parade was amazing. Plan to sit atleast 30 mins ahead of the schedule so that you get the best place to watch any show. The cheapest way to reach is via MTR and it takes approx 45 mins. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Had to skip several rides due to their long waiting time. However, whatever rides we took, most of these were not that thrilling. There were 2 parades on that day, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. Both were fun to watch, especially the evening parade with illumination was very attractive. There were no closing fireworks, told that it had been discontinued. There are restaurants inside the park, however foods were expensive and average in taste. It is an expensive affair; entry tickets, inside food etc. all are overpriced. Though at the end it was tiring, but overall it was a fun filling day spent at HK Disney Land.",Disneyland_HongKong

The space was huge and they had a very convenient luggage holding area for us to leave our luggage at HKD 110 per piece. A lot of walking involved, so was very glad we wore comfortable shoes and clothes. We bought discounted tickets via Klook and could get in with no problem. Once inside, we went to look at the rides and a lot of them were not thrill rides, but fun nonetheless. I was very impressed with the amount of detail that went into creating the rides and their upkeep. Everything is perfectly maintained and no chipping paint to be seen anywhere!Delicious food is nowhere to be found in Disneyland, though. So it's just eating to survive, and your tastebuds are not taken into consideration. We managed to take all the rides we wanted to, and still take in some shows before the park closed. In the evening, the lines were much longer, because HK residents came for the evening with their annual passes. It can rain anytime in HK, so pack a raincoat if you have it. Even if it doesn't rain, it will come in handy on the mine train ride. The parade at the end of the day was really cool! Since it was halloween season, all the Disney villains came out to play.",Disneyland_HongKong

How I wish I could watch the fireworks in front of the castle!Note: the haunted house is small and boring, not worth waiting in a long long queue. The grey bear mine, the star wars track, iron man are my favorite. The star wars track has speed pass, which is worth fetching asap.Wifi is extremely slow. Don't rely on it!

They had a wonderful day and during the afternoon Halloween Parade they were invited to take part, however they decided to decline as they are a bit shy. The parade was very well performed. Disneyland Hong Kong can at a push be done in a day. It is one of the smaller Disney global sites, however, what it lacks in size is made up for in atmosphere. It   s a great park and well worth a visit during your stay in Hong Kong. The MTR (mass transit railway) is the easiest way to get to the site.

I came all the way from Indonesia, paying expensive airfares, and also paying expensively for a 2 night stay at your hotel. But during my visit there, several sections, such as Adventureland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land.To make matters worse, the closure was done during the prime time of the park, around 2 3 pm all the way to the dark around 6 pm, and in some cases even until Disney closed. I was very disappointed in this, and I would like to see some responsibilities from Disney regarding this issue. Disney should've given a certain reduction on the hotel price and or Day Pass price due to this  incomplete magical experience .",Disneyland_HongKong

630734380,5,2018-3,United States,"English language travel books and blogs like to compare Hong Kong Disneyland to Ocean Park Hong Kong. Opened in 1977, Ocean Park often gets the nod over its 13 year old rival with the more scenic location, being three times larger, having a wider range of attractions and thrill rides, and for entertaining guests with shows starring not costumed characters, but live land and marine animals. Two categories in which Ocean Park is all wet, however, are food     ho hum carnival type fare versus Disneyland   s higher quality, wider ranging dining experiences     and, the deciding factor for me, what is known as    Disney Magic.    There   s something different about being at a Disney park     the hospitality, memory making, cleanliness, positive attitude, and characters and stories beloved for generations. It   s like coming home whether you went as a child or not. HKD is the smallest of all Disney parks, but that doesn   t make a visit any less magical and unique. Its version of the Haunted Mansion is Mystic Manor, which whisks guests through the Victorian home of world traveler Lord Henry Mystic. The mansion comes alive after Henry   s mischievous pet monkey Albert opens a music box that unleashes mayhem and enchantment. Another HKD exclusive is the exciting year old Iron Man Experience; imagine Stark Enterprises assuming sponsorship of Star Tours. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, HKD   s version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, has a section where riders go backwards. Just for fun, enter the    Cantonese    or    Mandarin    line at the Jungle Cruise to hear those tired, corny jokes in a different language. OK, so there   s no Matterhorn or Pirates of the Caribbean, but when was the last time you ate smoked duck legs and curry fish balls in Anaheim or Orlando?",Disneyland_HongKong

Between 10:30am and 2pm there are nearly NO queues at any entertainment   rides then it hits 2 3pm and the most popular rides have 30 50 mins waits. You CAN bring in water (I took in three bottles and showed them when entering and was let straight through) and a small amount of food, just don't bring a picnic. Sure the food is overpriced and substandard but this IS expected in theme parks.

My wife enjoyed the jungle ride and the cup and saucers as we always seen it on T.V.

Omg I could pull my hair out, I would seriously go bonkers if I had to work there. When my kids were small, we went many times and I have to say, they absolutely loved it every time. We even discovered that the best time to go is in the pouring rain as no one else is there and there are no queues! If it suddenly brightens up it will be about 2 hours before the crowds return, that, my friends, is a very good tip. Nowadays we never go and stuff like that I avoid like the plague but if you've got young kids then you just have to take them, they will love it. Remember tho, it's crowded as all hell, expensive, you can't take your own food so you are forced to eat at the restaurants and even buy water and the queues are long.

I had reservations about Hong Kong Disney as I have been to the other Disney parks and this one is obviously much smaller than what I am used to in the context of the magic of Disney!However, whilst small, it   s perfectly formed and there is still huge variety of things to do across the park. I would say it   s particularly geared for smaller children as the size suits their ability to get around the park and do everything. Highlights were the Flights of Fantasy parade (magical), toy story land (in particular the parachute ride) and It   s a Small World (my all time favourite!). It   s everything you would expect from Disney in a really nice bite sized dose which makes it perfect for a 1 day visit. ",Disneyland_HongKong

629073732,5,2018-10,United States,"Reading online I felt there was a huge feeling of inferiority to this Disneyland compared to its American counterparts but I can honestly say I had a great time! It may look small on a map but I would say it felt about the same size as Disneyland California. There is so much to see and do our only downtime was sitting down to eat twice the whole day. I would say if you are a hardcore Disney fan it can be a two day park but you can definitely do it justice in one.My favourite rides (in order) were Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Car, Hyperspace Mountain and The Iron Man Experiece**. We headed straight to The Iron Man Experience and Mystic Manor when we first got to the park and faced minimal wait time   When we returned later on in the day queues had built up but we stayed onsite at the Hollywood Hotel which provided us with Fast Passes which came in very handy in these instances.** Shout out to It   s A Small World and the Dumbo rides that hold a special place in my heart too**The shows at Hong Kong Disney were amazing too   Check out Festival of the Lion King, Mickey and the Wonderous Book and Mickeys PhilharMagic. I can   t remember enjoying shows at other Disney Parks as much. The We Love Mickey show was cool too and didn   t involve having to fight with crowds for a space down Main Street   the show is literally projected into the surrounding buildings so you can stand wherever you like. At the end of the day there was a Villains Night Out show keeping with the Halloween theme and involving popular villains from your favourite Disney movies. It was a lot of fun but mostly in Chinese so apart from a whole lot of cackling I wasn   t really too sure what was going on! (Shout out to Cruella who was giving it 100!!!)As well as the shows there were parades to see too. Mickeys Flight of Fancy was the best. Again, keeping with Halloween, there was a Halloween Street Party down Main Street which was fun but could have been avoided. The Hong Kong Disneyland app came in very useful when planning my day at Disney, providing show parade times and where they were located. As you can probably tell I am a Disney fan. I honestly had a great time and feel like people are a tad harsh in relation to this park (I was constant told not to expect too much). My only disappointments are:1) the size of Sleeping Beauty castle and the fact there was a lot of construction going on around it (   pardon our dust we are creating magic   ). As my partner pointed out the 15ft fence probably made the already small castle look even smaller but I am sure once they are finished it will look amazing and I will definitely be back to see for myself! 2) Despite the Disney Corporation priding themselves in magic and customer service I was a disappointed to not see this fully reflected in this park. Overall customer service was lacking in Hong Kong as a whole and I understand culturally it is a different world, but I was constantly disappointed in the rudeness I experienced during my trip and think it something that needs to be worked on at this park in order to keep in with the Disney magic.",Disneyland_HongKong

The MRT trip from downtown Kowloon is simple to say the least and took about 50 mins. The gates open at 10am for a wander and many photo opportunities with well loved characters, the    lands    open at 10.30am. The new Ironman experience was easy for a couple of grandparents and we thought the transformer ride at Universal Studios much more exciting. Young and old would love it....youths would find it tame. The staff are all friendly and extremely helpful and do their best to make it a happy place. We visited today, midweek and there were no lines for anything, whatever rude or experience you wanted you just wandered to it. There were 3 Main Street parades doe to being Halloween I think. They were good, quick and not crowded. The Lion King Show is a stand out, it was in 2013 and still is. The Star Wars ride is just the old Space Mountain ride with a new name. We enjoyed Toy Story land. As grandparents we enjoyed watching the expressions on the faces of children mostly aged between 3 to 6 they were in their element.

It is where Adults can be kids and kids to be thrilled by the magic. Firstly, if you are not staying in the Disney resort it is wise to buy your tickets online, also include your meal in the ticket as it is easier and cheaper. The package also includes a drink or ice cream AND a $50 voucher to spend at the Disney shop.We arrived close to opening time to beat the crowds but also remember the grand parade and fireworks are late evening, so check the show times and choose your arrival time accordingly. There is only one train connection in and out of Disneyland, don't stress about missing it as it runs every 10 mins etc. Entry during non peak season is quick, but beware bags are checked and no picnics, outside food or big drinks allowed.Once, inside the FUN begins, grab a map, review show times then run amok. If you are in a big family group like we were, separate and meet up when you  bump  into each other or at a arranged time as not every ride is suitable for everyone.The outer restaurants are quieter and are like food markets, make sure you take your voucher to validate if applicable.Queues for rides in October wasn't to long a wait between 5   25 mins, depends on type of ride as the more fast action rides went quicker as little kids could not go on them. The Dumbo ride was the best, simple BUT Fun. If you want the adrenalin rush then the Star Wars ride and the old Cabin Rail ride will do the trick. Skip the Halloween walk through journey, it's in Chinese with only one character speaking English. The  It's a Small World After All  ride in Fantasyland is so CUTE!Time flies and in no time the day ends as everyone is tired and themed park out.tyThanks to the Security staff who let our devastated 6 year old nephew re enter at the exit gate with his parents to search for his Disney cap he had left behind while posing for a photo just before exiting.

625623706,4,2018-10,India,"Very well organised place, good fun to spend a day with kids. If you plan well, can enjoy all the shows in a day's trip. However, timings for meeting various characters should be increased, especially if the crowds are large.",Disneyland_HongKong
625303443,4,2018-10,India,"We took a 2 day ticket as we were not sure with one day it can all be covered. The first day, we reached by 10 AM and being a weekday it was not very crowded. Its Halloween time and the place had parades and decorations for Halloween. Started with start trek and iron man rides and it was good. Remember, these rides are not as thrilling as the Universal studio and intended for young children (this is Disney!) Then proceeded to the shows and realized that shows get full if you don't reach early. The Moana show had very little seating and the security staff especially one male was kind of rude to people who were walking around. I guess they need to remember that they are not police and kids come with a lot of hope to see this. Not all staff are very fluent in English and when they speak in English they sound rather rude. (Don't stand here, I DON'T know, Move away! etc are the words you hear). Some of them really need a lesson on being 'polite while being assertive'.The food options as written by many others are disappointing for people who do not eat pork and beef, there are very few chicken options. We tried the Asian cuisine restaurants and they are very average when it comes to quality of food. For vegetarians, it's a day of fasting!! (kidding, but it is almost true).If you book from Disney site, you get $15 x2 coupons. The main street store refused to take more than one coupon for a transaction, I argued and they called the manager who confirmed the rule!   one coupon per transaction. But to my surprise on the second day of my visit another store inside (star trek or the fantasy land one) accepted 2 coupons on my wife's ticket. Surprising. Again I think its English language proficiency that is the culprit. Unpleasant experience.The parades were excellent, especially the 8 PM Halloween parade. Shows were also really good and I guess more than rides these are the things you shouldn't miss while in Disneyland.The second day was a Saturday and we could clearly see the difference in the crowd. It was crowded from 10 AM itself. We had only a few stuff pending and finished everything by lunchtime. Overall, it was a 1 and a half day visit and in my opinion, if you are not so particular about missing out a couple of rides you can cover this park in 1 Day itself   try to visit on a weekday.  MTR is connected to the park and transportation to the city is very easy.   There was no free Wi FI  The HongKong Disneyland app on Android can give you details of the shows. It just keeps crashing often on my Samsung phone but for a day it's manageable.  No food or drink allowed to be carried inside, Its mentioned everywhere but I still saw people getting caught in the security and wasting time in disposing off.  Many rides and attractions can be closed for public on a certain day due to 'private' events, details are updated on daily basis on the website and app. Check beforehand and plan.  You should be going at least 20 mins early for the shows, they get filled up fast.",Disneyland_HongKong
625141875,5,2018-10,Australia,I have been to Disneyland in Los Angeles so I can only compare the Hong Kong site to the original. I enjoyed this Disneyland very much. The staff were always friendly and helpful. We had a mix up with our pre bought tickets and they went out of their way to help us resolve the issue even offering us express passes to some of the popular rides. Having been there in October they had a Halloween theme throughout the park and line ups to rides were not long as it was out of the holiday season for Hong Kong residents. They were giving away lots of stickers and lollies in the Halloween themed garden where kids could make up small baskets to go trick or treating. This was all free. Food is standard theme park menu items. We had burgers and fries which was decent enough.The theme park is near the airport direction and it cost us approx $50AUD each way from our hotel in Mong Kok via Uber (we had 6 people and needed a large van).There is also complimentary wi fi throughout the park.Its a long and tiring day when you are there from 10:30am until 8:30pm at night but it is worth it to see all the parades as well as the rides and features. I recommend to attend over two days as we didn't get to see all the themed sections in the first day. The kids loved it and so did us adults.,Disneyland_HongKong
625139064,4,2018-10,Philippines,Disneyland Hong Kong is small compared to other Disneyland we visited. When we visited it wasn't that clean. Leaves from the trees are scattered in the alley.

625065180,3,2018-1,Singapore,"My first time at a Disneyland was rather disappointing; the queues were terribly long, the food was massively overpriced, and the rides were hardly thrilling. I supposed this park is catered mostly towards touristy families with young children, because there are much better things to do in Hong Kong and better cheaper theme parks such as Ocean Park. My advice is to go ahead to HK Disneyland if you are travelling with children or the elderly and have quite a bit of money to spare as it is a small theme park with expensive food and souvenirs but is extremely tourist friendly. If not, explore Hong Kong in its authenticity instead!",Disneyland_HongKong
624884437,2,2018-5,United States,The Disneyland here is way too commercialized   too many stores than rides compared to the ones in US!My brother did not enjoy it since the ultimate night show was cancelled & that was not announced in their website!It was a big disappointment for my supposed to be treat!,Disneyland_HongKong
624857744,4,2018-9,Australia,Compared to Disneyland In California this Park is smaller but in saying this it is still a memorable and enjoying experience. The only complaint we had was that it rained most of the day but it didn't detract from the great time we had,Disneyland_HongKong

624722169,4,2018-6,Indonesia,"I love Disney. I can say that I am Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse biggest fan. But I still can't get the idea of spending 2 3 days of your holidays in Disneyland. For that reason, I think the size of the area of HK Disneyland is perfect. It might be slightly smaller than other Disneylands, but for some people who does not want to spend their times in Disneyland (just like me), this place is great. I came to this place in June, when it was 32degrees celsius in HK. If I have to spend my whole day in Disneyland under the crazy sun of HK, I don't think I would make it. Lol. So it might be a good idea not to have a bigger area of Disneyland in 2 seasonal countries such as HK. Furthermore, you still can have all of the favourite rides and attractions. So, overall...i give it 4 stars. Highly recommended if you want to have Disneyland experience but unwilling to spend more than 1 day trip.",Disneyland_HongKong
624611488,4,2018-10,Thailand,"Best get in early as possible though, crowd & queueslow in the morning an as the day progresses obviously the queue time extends.I would start at Tomorrow Land and work your way around the park in a anti clockwise direction as I believe the rides are better and if you run out of time you haven't missed out on too much. Take something to eat in a back pack if with a young family as eating at the park is very expensive. All in all a great day with good family memories forever.",Disneyland_HongKong

624203838,5,2018-9,Singapore,"A day in Disneyland has always been magical. When me and my friends reached Sunny Bay Station to get to Disneyland Resort, we were greeted by a Disney themed train with Mickey shaped windows. Do bring along an umbrella or poncho just in case it rains and there is no shelter. Whether you are with a family of friends, you will enjoy the experience. Most rides cater to children but there are roller coasters and thrilling rides at Toy Story section. There is 2 halal certified store at Mainstreet Market and the Explorer's Club for muslim travellers. Do look out for the parades as kids will love it. Wear comfortable outfit and shoes if possible as the place is damn huge and require lots of walking. Highly recommended for all ages.",Disneyland_HongKong
624183786,2,2018-10,Australia,"When it comes to Disney, you expect wonderful things, but we were very disappointed with our overall experience here on our recent visit. The park is very small and doesn't have the magical vibe that Anaheim Disneyland exhibits. The majority of staff that we encountered had the personalities of bricks and showed no happiness or excitement. Food options were very average and opportunities for photos with characters were limited. With the park closing at approx 8:45pm on the day we visited, photos with Mickey and Minnie were closed off at 4pm, causing much disappointment from numerous visitors. The general upkeep of the park also seemed quite poor, with overgrown gardens and dirty grounds in some areas. While there was the advantage of much shorter queues for rides, this Disneyland just feels like another average theme park and doesn't even come close to comparing with the original in Anaheim. I wouldn't recommend visiting this theme park. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Unfortunately during our visit the Main castle was closed for renovation & many other rides were closed due to Typhoon hence had limited choice. Even in evening the fireworks was cancelled & replaced with Parade which was good.Too small compare to the one in Paris with two attractions Disney Park & Studio but still good.Suggest to book ticket in advance preferable online at discounted price.,Disneyland_HongKong

The castle is quite small (and at Oct 18 was undergoing maintenance and boarded up which was a shame). Some rides we hadn   t been on at other Disney parks.

623581485,4,2018-9,United Kingdom,All you would expect from a Disney site. The queues were short on the day which meant that we saw  rode most attractions in one day.

623356811,5,2018-9,Australia,"We took our 1 year old to visit Hong Kong Disneyland as a birthday treat. We went the day after the clean up from the typhoon   I was very impressed with their efficiency! We had a fabulous time. The baby had fun on  it's a small world after all  boat ride, the  Winnie the Pooh  train ride and the  Incredibles  ride. It was easy to get around with a stroller (compared to the rest of HK which isn't stroller friendly), had decent food options for babies at the cafe, decent baby change and breastfeeding facilities were available and the staff were very friendly. We enjoyed the fact that it wasn't as large as the other Disneylands so it was easier to see all the entertainment. As we were leaving for the night, they put on a special Halloween parade. It is easy to get to HK Disneyland via the metro but you do need to change at least once on the metro if your hotel is on another HK island e.g. Kowloon. It is also close to the cable car ride at Ngong Ping so if there is time and energy, I would recommend doing the two together on the day. See Ngong Ping first and take the cable car for a great view of the beauty of HK and then take the metro to Disneyland and enjoy the rest of the day and evening there.",Disneyland_HongKong
623339896,5,2018-9,South Korea,"Smaller than the original Disneyland in Anaheim, but even with its compact nature it packs a day full of fun. We got super lucky on our day, it wasn   t so crowded so my friends and I managed to do every single thing, except the little kids rides. There are a few unique rides and HKD, like mystic manor and the new iron man ride, which will give you bragging rights as they aren   t at other parks, but then standards like a Star Wars version of space mountain, it   s a small world, and my personal favorite the jungle cruise. As to shows, go see them all. They were so much fun and amazing. Even some shows are in multiple languages at once, it only adds to the charm. Lion King was my favorite. And the parades, especially the Villains parade at night was really fantastic. The food was also good and not unreasonable considering HK prices. And if you want special stickers be sure to ask cat members for help or questions and then you may get one. I got three. Over all amazing fun day. ",Disneyland_HongKong
623192942,4,2018-9,Canada,"While not nearly as robust as it   s Japanese, French and American counterparts, Hong Kong Disneyland has its charms. The number one perk: the crowds. I have never seen crowds so light at a Disney park. Nearly all rides were walk on the entire day     even the fantastic Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Minecars and Hyperspace Mountain. The downside to the low crowds: many rides, shops and food vendors all had off hours (with some of the latter not opening at all). But the food we did have was great, the people were friendly and it was actually kind of nice not to have to rush through the relatively small park. Worth a one day visit for the casual Disney park fan; two days only for the fanatics.

Food was great, very large serves, food vouchers with our entrance tickets were a good option and even if you choose a meal over the limit of the voucher value, you can paid the difference. The park itself might be smaller than most of the other parks around the world, but still you have all of the favorite rides and areas, we loved every minute of it. One of the highlights for us, was the amazing Lion King show. Lots of characters around the park, 4 great parades every day. Great family experience. ",Disneyland_HongKong
622786289,4,2018-10,Australia,We loved the experience and thought the rides were excellent. We stayed at Hotel Disneyland which I would highly recommend.Try to come in winter as the heat was almost unbearable during the middle of the day especially with 45 min queues due to Golden Week. It would be wonderful to see the park open until 10 or 11pm so that the rides could be enjoyed outside of the heat. We didn   t want to leave at 8pm!,Disneyland_HongKong

When we went to Disneyland on the Sunday before the Festival we didn't realise that the line to get into the park would be over an hour long at 10am. The heat was oppressive and there was far too little shade and water dispensers available. After waiting, waiting and waiting we gave up by 3pm (after only getting in at 11am!) and left.The park is very small compared to other Disneyland's but the crowds at the bag check at the entrance were like I have never, ever seen before. Crazy!",Disneyland_HongKong
622768816,5,2018-10,New Zealand,"Hong Kong Disneyland was the third Disney experience for my fianc  e and me after LA and Paris.It   s smaller than the other Disneylands, and could probably be done in one day, but we opted to pay the tiny bit more for a second day, and ended up very pleased with that decision as we felt we got a lot of payback out of doing rides multiple times. Hong Kong Disneyland seem really good at making the rides effective even if you   ve done them a lot before. Mystic Manor is probably the best example, the details and special effects are incredible, we were noticing new things the fifth time we did it.The Jungle Cruise is also great   we did it four times   with the guides genuinely funny and a great action packed circuit. One of the zebras was missing an ear though.It is the least impressive Space Mountain we have seen yet but still worth doing a few times. The cheap Star Wars overlay does not work, and you can see too much of the track and rigging inside   it really should be blacked out, I thought that was the point.We highly recommend the Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars, we really like it how they did it in their own style rather than just mimic Big Thunder Mountain.Generally the crowds are well behaved with very little queue jumping.We were there on a Thursday and Friday   the park got really busy in the afternoon so I would recommend doing the big attractions in the morning or at the end   in the last hour we were able to walk on to It   s a small world, Jungle cruise, and Grizzly Mine carts without any queue.I would also suggest doing Fantasyland as soon as the park opens   we did five rides in the first hour, which would have been impossible later in the day.The teacups here are the fastest we have experienced and the rides are overall fairly gentle on the head and neck but still a lot of fun. We didn   t really like the Disneyland Railroad (not much to see   this seems pointless outside of LA) and the Iron Man simulator, which looked suspiciously similar to Star Tours.Throughout Disneyland, the cast are not as exuberant as in LA and generally don   t add to the experience, apart from on the Jungle Cruise. But they are helpful and polite and most seem to speak enough English for us to not have to worry. The only time where our our experience was marred by our lack of any Chinese language was the seasonal walkthrough based on the Nightmare before Christmas. There were 5 or 6 sections, all but one were entirely delivered by characters speaking Chinese only, so we were not really able to follow it. Visually it was very impressive but they should have warned guests that they would not understand it if they didn   t speak Chinese because this was the only thing in the park not with no English and it had one of the biggest wait times.I would recommend that Disney seriously considers restricting people from using big sun umbrellas. The Fairy Tale Forest was pointless because people just stand with their umbrellas blocking everyone   s view.Overall the park is probably not as aesthetically impressive as LA or Paris but it still feels very Disney. One area where they excel is how they light up the park at night   it looks great.So going in we though it might not have the genuine Disney feel due to it being very small, but this turned out to not be a problem at all. We also noticed far less annoying stroller parking everywhere than in LA and far less smoking than in France. The food had very good Disney theming. We got our Disney fix and we would recommend it.",Disneyland_HongKong

In the last few years, we have checked out LA and Paris versions together. The park was great, alot better than expected and a nice size, meaning you could get around all the attractions if you spent the whole day there. The rides were longer than some of the other parks we have visited recently. Our only drawback, came from the shows on offer. The Lion King show was a spectacle to watch, with it being all singing and dancing, however, the songs didn   t sound the same, with varying notes used by the performers. We also went to the Moana show, expecting to see and hear some of the great music, but this time there was no music at all involved. Maybe it is hard to find performers at the right ability, but it is a slight area of improvement, if I was being picky. Overall, it was a great day out and I would highly recommend it, Tip   It   s obviously very hot, so make sure you take lots of water with you, as it   s fairly expensive in the park. Tip   We went on a Tuesday, hoping it would be quiet but was very busy, possibly as it was the day after China Day, so try go on a slower day to get around everything. ",Disneyland_HongKong

621719662,5,2018-9,India,"Luckily i had kept Disneyland stay for the end of my family trip. The moment one enters the sprawling premises, one realises that only an American venture can be so elaborate, high tech & beautiful. With nothing much to do for a family visiting Hong Kong (in terms of activities involving kids), Disneyland more than made up for it. Built like a fairy  fantasy land with separate sections, one ideally needs 2 full days to be able to enjoy everything. Crowded like mad, there are long queues even for getting snaps clicked with disney characters all over. The 3 parades in a day were a spectacle to watch esp the end of the day as it was Halloween Theme in place. However, my son was hugely disappointed as he totally missed out on doing  Adventure Land  & still regrets it. Fault wasnt ours as we spaced out everything well after finding out shut down time from staff  site who told us it was 2000h. however, when we reached Adventure Land at about 1915h with 45mins to spare, it had totally shut down & nobody could explain as to why as all other sections were still open. Also, we had lost about an hour in the morning view heavy rains. But the authorities wouldnt allow us even limited entry of an hour into the Adventure Land the next day. that i personally feel was highly unprofessional & insensitive as THEY had shut down the section way before closing time. My son still feels miserable when he talks about the trip. So ideally, stay inside for 2 nights   just the right amount of stay. Its worth every penny",Disneyland_HongKong

Food was pretty pricey but was delicious. Was great seeing the halloween theme throughout the park and incorporated into their food design too.

621647330,5,2018-9,Philippines,"It's our first Disneyland trip and it did not disappoint. We went there for the little bro's birthday celebration but I think it was me that enjoyed the most. I was running and lowkey screaming when we got to the entrance arch. HAHA. A whole day is required to enjoy all the rides. We went there a little over lunch and we missed some. Lines were already forgiving during our trip since we went there on a Saturday in September, not a popular time to visit since blogs say it's already starting to rain in HK during September. Luckily, it was sunny during that time. And we only waited in line for an average of 10 minutes, I guess. Lucky, right?? Food will cost you a lot so it's better to eat outside and come with a full stomach. But if it cannot be avoided, there are food stalls inside. The sausages at Toy Story Land were good. !!!!DO NOT MISS THE HYPERSPACE MOUNTAIN RIDE AT TOMORROWLAND!!!! SO INTENSE!!!! The Small World ride was very cute and chill and relaxing, you should try that too. Since January 2018, there were no more fireworks display to close the day. To compensate, they do character parades three times a day. Because of this, we were not able to take photos with the characters (we prioritized the rides hehe) since no longer entertain photo ops at 5 PM, because the staff will be getting ready for the closing parade. No regrets tho. The rides were super fun. Merchandise is will also cost you a lot, by the way. But again, NO REGRETS! :)",Disneyland_HongKong

You can do the whole park in a half day. Don   t go on a Chinese Holiday or it will be flooded with Mainland Chinese tourists. Pretty much the same as every other Disneyland just 10% of the size. Take advantage of the fast pass system. If your ticket is crumpled or broken and the machine won   t accept it, there is a small inconspicuous button on the back of the fastpass machine that will print a fast pass ticket for you. Unscrupulous visitors can press it repeatedly to get multiple rides without waiting in line. Visit the rides that don   t have fast pass first or last thing.

621228157,4,2018-9,South Africa,We felt like kids! First experience at a Disney. It truly is magical. Everything is themed! From the toys to the food! Was disappointed about the castle still being under renovation. Also take note of the times to get your picture taken with the various characters around the park. We were too late to get our Mickey and Minnie picture. The food voucher was well worth it. Food portion was large. Drinks are expensive but you must stay well hydrated for the amount of walking that is done. We did not use the fast pass as the park was not very busy. The shops are amazing and have the cutest items to purchase. Had to control ourselves! The parade at night was so much fun.

It ended so randomly after 5 walk throughs and majority in cantonese only (4 out of 5) On top of all we hardly queued at all the rides and waited the longest to go to this! 45 minutes. Whoever came up with the walk through story needs to sort out the    ending    of it. The actors tress were great though especially Sally the Rag Doll (shes really amazing from her make up to her voice) Jack was of course good and the themed rooms and decoration. But really got to pay attention from the start to end! Ending really impacts the guests impression too and our whole group of 12 15? were like wtf at the end.

They don't have a good pin selection here  just stickers? Not impressed since we traditionally get pins from Disney world every time we go. Customer service is not Disney level. People avoided eye contact, only approached us at the dining cafe when we we're signaling for help, and some cast members were on their cell phones! We we're trying to buy storm trooper magnets and we had to wait for someone to look up from their phone and ring us up. The roller coasters are fun and there were no lines it being a Wednesday. Super clean bathrooms and park. Toy story land is small but the rides are good for kids. They decorated for Halloween so it was enjoyable to see. Due the damages from the typhoon, the jungle cruise was closed  no biggie but I probably won't want to come back specifically for that ride. Thank goodness for the good company I was with.

Who would have thought there would be a train with Mickey Mouse head shaped windows? Cool!It   s a reasonable walk from the terminal to the actual entrance, but lots of things to look at (including of course lots of options to take your money!).The actual Park itself is very good. The various    lands    clean and slick, though staff in many are pretty slow to make things happen. Rides including roller coasters are fun and there is plenty for every age or level of    adventure    tolerance. Integration of Star Wars and Marvel themes are good, as is Toy Story Park area and Grizzly Gulch. Have to say that after a day I was theme parked out, but I can see that people that love Disney or theme parks could get far more out of it than me and over a couple of days. Certainly worth visiting if in Honk Kong. ",Disneyland_HongKong

All shows were good but personally i enjoyed watching festival of the lion king   musical stage show re telling the story of Simba (Hakunama Tata). Waiting time for each ride is around 10 15 minutes (weekends). See if there is a FASTPASS distribution sign near the entrance of the attraction you want to ride. Cartoon characters too have resting time therefore, there's a possibility of missing out on few. Night parade is Spectacular.Quick Tip: At the time of heavy rain you may visit the nearest Disney shop and buy a raincoat worth HKD 60. Available for both adult and child and walk freely in Disneyland",Disneyland_HongKong
620201737,4,2018-9,Taiwan,Hong Kong Disneyland is amazing. We took the MTR from Kowloon to HK Disneyland and the trains are adorable. The Mickey Mouse windows and then the various statues of Disney characters were so fun to see. We arrived before the park opened and got to watch a family open the park. This family the mom was cutely dressed and the kids were in different Halloween costumes and they were picked to open up Disney. It was SO adorable. Right now Disneyland is decorated all for Halloween and there is an area for the Villians to be out and planning. The music is a variety of Halloween music. Mickey and Minnie mouse were dressed for Halloween. Here is my opinion....HK Disneyland is a great place to go. If you want to go on the rides as long as you are going during a peak time (which I'm not sure when that would be    we went during the Moon Festival) but for most rides we waited no more than 20 minutes. However meeting the characters could ranges from waiting for 5 minutes or you could be waiting for over an 1 hour. Food    if you are okay with not air conditioner you could grab your food and eat outside on the tables outside the restaurant.,Disneyland_HongKong

The waiting time for rides are shorter than expected, probably because it was a weekday (but public holiday) and not during summer holidays.

And then we used our express pass given complimentary by Disneyland Hotel for all the fun rides and attractions, highly recommend space mountain because anything that is airconditioned and fast never fails to disappoint. After we've finished our priority passes we bought some slushies and popcorns to snack on and walked around to take polaroids with the characters around.

Didn't see any other characters walking around except for the Halloween characters and Mickey once they started playing the Mickey song in the street. A lot of people but maybe because they have holiday now. Recommend the jungle ride.Thumbs up! ",Disneyland_HongKong
619461372,4,2018-7,United States,"This may be the most beautiful of the Disneylands I've visited (LA, Orlando, Shanghai and Hong Kong) but it has the least to offer of them. We stayed and I recommend staying in the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel and were given paper FASTPASSes we could use on Ironman Experience, Hyperspace Mountain, Mystic Manor, Grizzly Gulch roller coaster, and Mickey's PhilharMagic (which we didn't see as we have seen it numerous times in WDW). You get a certain number of FP for each person per night you stay based on your level of room. We stayed in a Kingdom Club Room and received 4 passes per night per person so we had 16 passes as we stayed four nights for 5 attractions. I threw some away and gave some away because it was simply too many for such a small park to even want to ride those same five attractions that many times! But I highly recommend this for at least one night. Staying in the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel also gets you into Mickey and the Wondrous Book's first show in first which we did. We were still able to get a FASTPASS for Winnie the Pooh in the park as well and used a VIP tour to do all the rest of the rides skipping the line and for a private viewing area of the nighttime parade (which we didn't need as it wasn't crowded compared to US park standards even in July and we watched the parade from the upstairs of the RR station on Main Street with no one around us and a superb view). We were able to ride things multiples times and see all shows we don't have in our American parks. We had a great time but there is far less to do here and it does not require more than a day if you plan correctly. They don't have a lot of newer amazing attractions like Shanghai did and it was extremely hot in July so I'm only giving it four stars.",Disneyland_HongKong

They recovered from the typhoon rather quickly. Most everything was open and you would never know the typhoon passed through here. The Ironman Experience is cheesy. It was just a photo opportunity with person in Ironman costume who used pre recorded voice. The Moana: A Homecoming Celebration is outdoors in a half covered venue. Also cheesy, but the kids seemed to like it. The Moana character sorta looked like Moana. The ladies might want to watch the movie again to do hula correctly. It was funny to see one of the drummers with a body suit to make him look tanned with Maori tattoos.The parade had the normal characters Toy Story, Lilo & Stitch, etc. Seemed shorter than the American version.Overall, this little Disney is entertaining for the children and maybe teenagers.

The cast are attentive and in character, the facilities are world class and the rides continually met Disney   s high standards. Our kids always love it, and as they get older, find new aspects of the park to love. Grisly gulch and mystic manor have climbed to the TOP of their list as favourite rides, and Groot is the new favourite character.

One of the good things about the HK Disneyland is that you don   t have to walk a long way to get to each attraction as the park is not big. Compared to those in other cities such as the Disneyworld in Florida, for a slow walker like me, it   s pretty tiring to walk to each attraction, though there are some means of transport that I could use, for example the bus.And because it   s small, visitors can easily explore the whole park in just one day, giving them more time to see other beautiful places in HK.And for those visitors who like Chinese food, don   t forget to try the Plaza Inn, delicious chicken and suckling pig.

But the best part for me are the shows we watched   Feast of the Lion King, Mickey's Philharmonic Theater and Storybook. It was like going back to my childhood days. So nostalgic, specially for a Disney fan like me. The parade was the main highlight for me which I totally enjoyed. One of the things I was disappointed about is that there were no fireworks because Sleeping Beauty castle was closed for renovation.

The park was closed during our stay for one day and many things in the park were not running or closed. All we asked was to be able to use our passes on Saturday to make up for the closed day and the other problems as we leave Sunday.He gave us the magical template answer with a NO, passes cant be used on Saturday with no consideration.

Best rides were Iron man and having visited most of the other Disney parks they have a totally different take on the Haunted Mansion. As with all other Disney parks merchandise was very expensive. The parks is covered with free WiFi.",Disneyland_HongKong

A handful of good rides for adults makes it enjoyable. Don   t expect many thrill seeking rides here. The layout of the park and the themed detail that goes into the attraction is fantastic. A one day pass is all that is needed to get around to all the attractions. Only disappointment was the lack of food stalls and the lack of variety. Many stalls were closed. Kids had hotdogs which did not seem fresh. The 1.30pm parade was fantastic and a must see for all ages. ,Disneyland_HongKong

This park is much smaller and rides are similar, maybe with a different name, but similar to whats in Orlando. One big difference was Toy Story land, which reminded me of Hollywood Studios. These rides we hadn't seen before and they were super fun, even for an 11 and 13 year old. The lines in August were what you'd expect, most 45 minutes  if not more. We stayed at Disney property and were given what was basically fast passes for some of the rides.

If you expect western style junk food, think again, this was worse. The rides were good. Queue discipline was at times bad with ignorant people shoving their kids past us and when their kids cried out that the adults couldn't get by to join them, we reluctantly let them through too. The fairytale castle, tiny as it is was behind hoardings as I guess they were working to add extra magic with the diggers that were there. Go to Ocean Park instead.",Disneyland_HongKong
615022892,4,2018-3,Australia,"We went with our 2 year old and found HK Disneyland was great. We wished that we had booked a night at their hotel (despite it costing more than our hotel back in Sai Yin Pun). It would have meant that we could spend more time at Disneyland and get to stay for the fireworks at night. We went on a relatively quiet day, but the lines were still too long to bother getting photos with the characters that made random appearances throughout the day. Lines were good for the rides that were age appropriate for our 2 year old and we still managed to spend the whole day there, but not see everything. If we had another opportunity to go back, we would invest the few extra dollars to stay at the Disneyland hotel and therefore spend more time there. Cost is to be expected going to a theme park, and they had a lot of Chinese food available for lunch. Either that or expensive Mickey Mouse shaped waffles. The train that takes you to Disneyland from Sunny Bay was Disney themed and pretty cool. We actually went several years ago, not in March 2018, but was worth the belated review.",Disneyland_HongKong

We had a great time here, from the minute we got on the Disney Train, all the way till we left. It was really hot, and there is not much shelter, so you'll have to find respite in rides and shops. There are not that many rides here, and it's probably something you can do in 1 2 days at a leisurely pace, especially if it's not busy (there weren't any rides that had longer than 15 minutes wait when we went on a weekday).There are some unique features of this park  Mystic Manor, and some characters who we have never met before, like Cookie (friend of Duffy). Lilo is also here.The food here is expensive, and there is less variety than the US. No dedicated ice cream store, only one churro cart, etc..With little crowds, this was quite a good experience for us. The castle is small, but they're upgrading. Transport from the city is easy, and surprisingly quick, even when we left with all the others after the Paint the Night Parade.",Disneyland_HongKong
614892974,4,2018-7,Saudi Arabia,A nice place to visit with the family especially if they are early teens or younger. We got a very good deal through Air Asia with 20% off which made it even better. It is better to buy the meal deal from the site as that is economical compared to buying it individually provided of course if you are going to use for both lunch and dinner. Only issue is if it rains or signs of inclement weather then a lot of rides are stopped which could spoil your day and crowding at all indoor rides,Disneyland_HongKong

612301758,3,2018-8,United Kingdom,"As part of our trip to Hong Kong, Disneyland was definitely a must do. Having visited other Disneyland   s in the past, this one full filled some of our expectations, but not all.The arrival was easy, as well as entertaining. With special Disney MTR trains, a manicured Station, a grand sign leading up to the park, and a fountain with Mickey surfing above Moby Dick with all his friends watching.We walked straight to the gate queues having bought our tickets (from Klook) and printed them of as instructed. Unfortunately not everyone had done so, and there was chaos as people tried to find get their QR codes to work from their phones as they held up the every increasing line. The park opened at 10am, but no rides were open until 10.30. Even then not all. Sleeping Beauty   s Castle is under refurbishment, so can   t be seen properly or accessed. We rode and enjoyed The Iron Man experience which was a simulation ride, after getting fast passes for Space Mountain. The Jungle Cruise was ok, with queues for the 3 different languages. Don   t be fooled by the short English queue. After riding Space Mountain, we watched the Jedi Training. They catered well again for the different languages using them all. The kids were great.Unfortunately after that the heavens opened, and it poured with rain. There didn   t appear to be enough places for people to shelter, in regards to indoor rides or covered areas. Big puddles everywhere. However the silver lining was they did open Mystic Manor which was closed for the day.Overall not loads of rides, but lots of character meeting areas (with queues of course).

611506887,4,2017-11,India,"This theme park suits the kids very well. However, I was clueless as to why this park had a 2 days pass that sells.

Otherwise, the place is beautiful, food is great, costly of course. The 4D effect in theatre experience of Iron Man was well created. But the post sunset fireworks were an absolute visual delight and you need to stay back till 7:30 pm to make your visit feel complete. Easy to commute to Disneyland by MTR: East Tsim Sha Tsui         Nam Cheong         Sunny Bay         Disneyland.

611414876,4,2017-10,Hong Kong,"I am barely qualified to gauge the quality of this or any other Disneyland: I don't have kids, and have not been to a Disney theme park since the 1980s. But Ladyfriend and I decided not long after we moved here to spend the weekend on Lantau, and so here we are. And to be frank, I enjoyed HK Disneyland. It's really small, as I am sure other reviewers have mentioned, which means that it's doable in two or three hours (maybe longer if you have kids?), and although it is missing (m)any of the thrill rides that other Disney properties feature (you'll have to go to Ocean Park for that...), it's a nice way to spend an afternoon.I'm not going to explain what Disneyland is. But I do have some tips.   Go on a weekday. I have never been on a weekend, but am sure it gets crowded. We didn't hit a single line on a Tuesday  They don't start serving booze until early evening. I don't know what my advice is on this front other than maybe  go later,  but I will say a propos of nothing that there is very little stopping one from hitting the 7 11 beforehand and bringing some roadies.  Lunch options are few, so same as above, although once you're in it's definitely not as expensive as other Disney parks in terms of food. There's a multinational, cafeteria style restaurant that is not great, but certainly gets the job done is doesn't break the bank.Note: I shouldn't have to even write this, but if you are visiting HK and looking for an  authentic  HK experience, do NOT go to Disneyland. Stick to the main island and to Kowloon, where there are a million awesome things to do and see. But if you have kids, or like rides, or need to check this Disney experience off of your bucket list, or have some sort of personal Disney thing such that you are all but mandated by your therapist or something to spend as much time as possible in the happiest place on earth, I won't try to dissuade you. Again, it's small enough that you can spend the morning doing actual HK stuff, and then spend the afternoon here, or vice versa. It's also pretty close to the action; if you're taking public, expect about a 90 minute ride from Central, but the nice thing is that Disneyland has a dedicated MTR line, complete with Mickey's head shaped windows and straps.Finally, here are the rides you want to go on, at least as an adult, as agreed upon by Ladyfriend and myself:1. Hyperspace Mountain (a very small scale Star Wars themed ride that piggy backs on the Space Mountain concept). It's less scary than an actual roller coaster, but there are some stomach drops. If I were big brothering a kid who was very frightened of roller coasters, I would make him go on this to build his confidence. There are a couple of cool SW tie ins as well.2. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. It's all there in the name, and it's a fun little ride.3. RC Racer. This is their version of the big, swinging pirate ship ride that many of us grew up with. Stomach drops galore.4. Toy Soldier Parachute Drop. Your bench seat is hoisted way up high (affording one of the best views all day), and then... you drop. 5. Iron Man Experience. This is a VR experience that is several notches above seeing an action film in 4DX. It's OK for adults, but I suspect elementary aged kids would love it.",Disneyland_HongKong

Popcorn and Minnie waffles We liked the fact that we did not have to pay extra for fast pass all we had to do was to put our ticket in and it gave us the times for our fast pass. That was awesome! The heat was killing us though!",Disneyland_HongKong
610044454,4,2017-10,Australia,Best place ever. Full of so many thinks to do. A full day is exhausting and so many things to do and see. The food is expensive there and very average.

609708656,3,2018-4,Hong Kong,"The place is nice and clean, but small. It is the smallest Disneyland I have been. The place it is perfect for little kids. Monday it is the best day to go, we didn't have to wait to use the rides.",Disneyland_HongKong
609410538,4,2018-8,Australia,"You'll need stamina and patience but this is a good place to spend 10  hours with your kids, there are plenty of great attractions and everything is don't to a high quality. however like all Disneylands, wait times can be long   especially to meet get photo with characters... allow at least 30 min per character so get your kids to choose carefully otherwise you'll pay a fortune to spend the day getting a few photos. Best Things:1. Rides and attractions are great, as are shows like Lion King. 2. Everything is clean and well maintained.3. Its so easy to get to and from with the MTR (train) or taxisWorst Things:1. Food is very expensive and wait times can be very long (eg 30  minutes for McDonalds!) for pretty basic fare. 2. Wait times for photos with Disney characters are very long, some active 'people management' should be employed to make it 15 seconds per photo opportunity then move on! 3. Guest Relations are almost useless   dont expect help or understanding from them and they don't care if your kids are howling and your are distressed.",Disneyland_HongKong
609401410,5,2017-12,Philippines,"We stayed at their hotel for a night. We were already expecting that we would be needing at least a day to fully enjoy the place. As expected. Disneyland did not disappoint us. The park is beautifully decorated. The rides and entertainment are amazing. We went there on December and it wasn't even cold. So don't wear heavy clothes. I almost fainted of heat. Good thing I brought an extra blouse. They have great restaurants around. We tried this Chinese Restaurant that offers very big bowl of noodle soup. It's good for 2 persons I guess. But we ordered one each. So we did not finish it. The rides are just very... cute. Really for kids. No life threatening rides which some people enjoy. But all in all, it's a great stay. Even the hotel did not disappoint. They sell Disney merchandise which are great souvenirs.",Disneyland_HongKong
609356988,5,2018-8,United States,I went to HK Disneyland from Wanchai on a rainy Friday afternoon. It was easy to get to on the MTR. The park was not too crowded and lines were fairly short. For some reason the Jungle Cruise line was longer than any other I waited for! Lucky for me they had a line for English speaking and the    river guide    spoke in clear English. Which is more than could be said for the train conductor whose English was indistinguishable from her Chinese. The castle was under construction but I was informed of that before I paid. I had a wonderful afternoon and four hours was plenty. ,Disneyland_HongKong
609062554,3,2017-9,United States,"This Disneyland is the smallest one compare with all others over the different parts of the world. However, it's amazing for Hong Kong, such a small place, to has a Disneyland. It's fun if you have not been any other Disneyland before. Don't expect too much and don't try to compare this one with others over different side of the world. I may say all the Disneyland theme parks are about the same, just different sizes and one have more rides than the other.",Disneyland_HongKong

608155012,5,2017-10,Israel,Been in Hong kong Disneyland twice. It is a smaller version of the Eurododney and the original Disneyland in the US.The Hong kong Disneyland specializes in shows which is a fantastic add on to the park usual stuff. I found this place very enjoyable and much better for the parents because you can catch up almost everything in less than a day. Very recommend!!,Disneyland_HongKong
607862846,5,2017-9,Australia,By far the smallest Disney. Easy enough to get most done in 1 day. Went during week so not so many kids. Has all the classic Disney features but on a smaller scale.,Disneyland_HongKong
607732296,4,2018-4,Sweden,"Travelled earlier this year in April.Very smooth getting to Hong Kong Disney by the MTR. Traveling with 3 young kids was fairly easy and smooth.Having visited most of the Disney parks we had quite high expectations for this park, and they were met. As soon as you board the Disney train from sunny bay station you can see and feel that there was no expenses spared. We visited on a Saturday and it was busy but not overcrowded.At the time not all the rides open and there were a few parts under construction or renovation including the main castle.Average wait time for the characters was about 1hr. Average queue time for kids rides was about 30mins.We opted for the 3 in 1 meal pass which worked out best for us.Our lunch meal was at royal banquet hall which was surprisingly very good, considering it was theme park food. And dinner was at Clopin's Festival of Foods, and this was amazing! Coming from Stockholm, I have to admit that the food we got from this restaurant was better than anything I   ve had in sweden. (Please check pics)Whether you visit Hong Kong disney with kids or not it is worth a visit! Who doesn   t like a day at a theme park? ",Disneyland_HongKong
607546941,2,2018-8,Thailand,Attraction are not a lot.   Klook is a cheapest way to buy a ticket but recommend to not buy a value meal and reason is in a photo i share.  About popcorn is not good cooked.,Disneyland_HongKong
607528996,4,2018-7,Australia,"Disneyland Hong Kong was beautiful! My husband and I spent a day there and thoroughly enjoyed it. The center of the park was having renovations done which was disappointing but all the other attractions were up and running. The park was well organised, clean, easy to navigate and if you get there early you beat the lines and the heat.",Disneyland_HongKong
607203304,4,2018-8,United States,"Tip buy the discounted ticket on Klook. We spent less than a day at the park, and had plenty of time to do everything. Most of the lines were not long.

607190939,4,2018-8,New Zealand,"We found that even in the wet, Disney was fun. There was enough shelter in most places that you didn't get soaked but I would bring a brolly. We didn't do any shows (not the thing for Mr 4.5) but he loved the Paint the Night Parade. If you can take a break in the afternoon (when its very hot) and come back in the early evening, I would   otherwise its a very long day for little ones. MTR is very convenient.",Disneyland_HongKong
606904235,5,2018-8,South Africa,Our 1st ever experience at a disney land resort. It was lovely. Like the rest of Hong Kong You Gotta Be Prepated To Walk Walk Walk. Extremely unusual rides. Fun Characters. Dont let the rain put you off.The toy shops are wow Even adults were buying stuff lol.Only downside is no muslim prayer room but there is 1 stand near the entrance selling halaal food.Try the caramel popcorn. Too tasty and the smell is divine.,Disneyland_HongKong
606844266,5,2018-7,United States,"Definitely the smallest of all the Disney theme parks world wide, but it stores a really strong punch of Disney Magic! I visited during the 13th anniversary of the theme park. They are going through major renovations in 2018 and are slated to build a brand new castle! Perhaps by 2021 it will be completed! I've been to all the Disney theme parks and I must say this definitely takes the Chinese culture and melds it in with the traditional Disney experience. They offer grilled squid as a snack! Toy Story Land is a definitely Must See... YOU MUST go on the Mystic Manor ride! It's so much fun and offers a different vision of the Haunted Mansion ride! Another ride you must do is the Iron Man Experience which is similar to Disneyland's Star Tour's ride, except it takes you to Stark Expo where Hydra starts causing mayhem and Tony Stark saves the day! Definitely a totally different ride from anywhere else and totally worth the wait! I'd also suggest staying here if you have the chance! The hotel's Disney Dim Sum is too cute to miss out!",Disneyland_HongKong
606587111,3,2018-7,South Africa,Quite expensive for not so much to see and do. Rides overcrouded with waiting times of an hour or more. If your first time it might be okey but not for a second visit.,Disneyland_HongKong
606564906,3,2018-8,Australia,we when in August and it was Monday and still a lot of people.we did it for the kids but the weather is really hot and humidity is like 80% plus. they do the big pride at the end just before they close and imagine every one going home at the same time.,Disneyland_HongKong

606245481,5,2018-8,Hong Kong,"I've been to HK Disneyland for more than 10 times and I would say this first ever Pixar Water Play Street Party is one of my favourite. First reason is I'm specially fond of Mr Incredible and his family and Frozone. They're just too cute! Another reason is the chance to get wet and cool down during the summer. Who doesn't love the idea of water   dance   party under the sun? LOL. I believe this is a special for summer only. Hope to go again before it ends.Ah btw, they also added Zootopia meet & greet. Another must do!",Disneyland_HongKong

606117019,3,2018-8,Colombia,The park has some unique attractions that are not in other Disney parks. The staff is rude and never smile. There's not fireworks show.  The parade and the mapping at night is amazing.  The Iron Man atraction is great.,Disneyland_HongKong
606070688,2,2018-7,United States,"So many things were missing from this park. The castle is so small it is embarrassing and I did not find the American experience translated well. Food prices are obscene   $5 for a bottle of water   so bring your own water if nothing else. There are water fountains but the water is burning hot   really   and I was hesitant to drink it. Mystic Point was a great addition to the park as was Hyperspace Mountain. Strange hours   opening at 10 and closing at 9pm. Also, the train stopped at 6pm which was super disappointing! Why?? Really overall it seemed like a money grab and while the day was enjoyable, as someone in our party (who is a HUGE Disney fan) commented, the place  Is missing the magic . And I agree. Not a bad amusement park   the rides were fun   but the prices... .OUCH! Easy to get to though and the train there is fantastic. Also, a very nice train station at the park so that I highly recommend.",Disneyland_HongKong

We had such a great time with all the rides, the themes of the different parks, the food, the personalised waffles and Jelly in the shape of Mickey Mouse, all the small and big details are just WOW! The different shows are a must see so check the schedules. The parade at night is so amazing and beautiful. The down side when we visited was that the castle was under construction so didn't have that show and get to see the castle or all the princess but what a wonderful day. I would recommend using the MTR and Disney Train for an additional experience instead of the bus..You have to do more than 1 day in order to see all the areas or experience the rides, its a long long day and the parks are expensive so make sure you budget for it but its definitely a must to do and see!

The parade was also very nice. Tried the train which stoped us after 2 minutes and told us they were closing for technical reasons which was annoying as we had to go back to the entrance to pick up the child cart we left to enter the ride. Not many rides for our son , in fact not many rides in the park we were expecting slightly more. The prices for food obviously high, water included.

Many of the old favorites were missing this time   or perhaps they are no longer there! There does not appear to be any  Crowd control  they just kept arriving and being allowed entry   surely there is, or should be, a maximum limit! The most famous structure, well, Disney one that it, is the Castle. Once you could walk thru, into or around but not on my day. The lower 40% or so was covered up.

601959321,5,2017-10,Indonesia,"Buy the ticket from one of the travel agent in Jakarta that give us 10% discount. It's really helpful to cut the queue time on the main entrance.Has been excited since the our journey from thung chung MTR station to sunny bay. From sunny bay there's a special MTR with the mickey and minnie mouse had window.We spend the whole day in there from it's open until closing. Most of the rides will makes us queue for about 15 20 minute, but still makes us happy. To bad we only had 2 chance to take a photo shot with disney figures since we didn't notice the scheduleThe area completed with a moslem prayer room which very clean but no equipped with the praying clothes, so we have to prepared it by ourselves.We really enjoy a 2 times parade, it's very entertain and also enjoy the closing fire work which very famous and spectacular.It's really a best place to visit ever, never to old to go to Disneyland",Disneyland_HongKong
601666334,5,2018-2,Australia,Unfortunately the castle area was closed for construction however We were lucky enough to get in free via uncle working at Disneyland so I   m not sure about cost wise. We did however enjoy the food the atmosphere turning 23 celebrating here was still a dream as usual for all theme parks go early so you have enough time to enjoy everything. But not too early as the night show at Disney land is even better than the shows during the day. The lion king performance is a 20 10!!! Amazing oh and fried chicken and the sausage rolls have my heart! Definitely visit this magical place,Disneyland_HongKong
601651411,5,2018-8,United Kingdom,"Hong Kong Disneyland is amazing! The best Disneyland I have been to! It isn   t that big and the lines for the rides aren   t that long.

601345881,5,2018-7,Australia,"Hong Kong disney not the biggest but would you miss it if you went to Hong Kong I wouldn't, this time it was still school holidays and there were heaps of people but the biggest wait for a ride we had was 5 minutes the biggest we saw was 20 for space mountain make sure you have a hat to keep the sun off although there is plenty of shade around. We spent around 7 hours there just couldn't hang out until the light show but the parade during the day was fantastic so don't miss it we went on rides and watched both a 3 D film show and a stage show that were both great and gave us a bit of a break out of the heat seating down in the air conditioned theatres on top of that there there are plenty of drink and food outlets scattered around the park together with your Disney souvenirs and they are not that expensive compared to what your use to paying in Australia.",Disneyland_HongKong

600565694,4,2018-7,New Zealand,This is a smaller disneyland which doesn't have all the draw cards of the larger resorts like tokyo or USA. The cost is expensive for what's here priced at $124 new zealand. Due to the heat it would be better to visit from 2pm until closing as this would give you time to enjoy the park and see the parades. Do take your own food and drink as food here is expensive. The waiting time for most rides can be up to an hour but you might get lucky. Get a fast past to avoid the lines.

599421720,5,2018-7,Philippines,"It's so nice HK has specific station that would take you to Disneyland. So hassle free and easy. We arrived there at 11AM. Tip: buy tickets in advance at klook or kkday as it will save your time queueing. Be there weekdays as tourists flock during weekends. We were so happy the weather was so good! Initially we checked the weather one week before and it states that thunderstorms will occur but it turned out sunny! We were able to enjoy almost all the rides, almost but not all. There are still some live shows but I am not really a fan of it. For me, one day is enough as HK's disney is smaller compared to HK Shanghai and Paris, accordingly. If you're visiting during summer, bring gear up comfortable outfits as it is really hot, and wear rubber shoes as it really involves a lot of walking. ",Disneyland_HongKong
599256920,5,2018-6,United Kingdom,"When we visited the castle was under construction but it certainly didn't take away the Disney magic. It was an amazing sight seeing the park contrasted against the green mountains. There are loads of rides and shows to fill 1 2 days. However there aren't very many shops in main street USA. Still enough to get your Disney goods.Toy story land was roughly the same size as Paris. Their 'big thunder mountain' ride was a high lite. One of the best rides I have ever been on in Disney park. We all came off in fits of laughter and were so unprepared for all the twists and surprises.We could see there were more marvel rides being built so the park is expanding.There aren't as many restaurants as the other parks however there is a fair amount of variety. The food isnt massively catered towards western culture however you can still get burgers, fried chicken ect.Being a huge Disney fan I absolutely loved the park and would love to go back once the new castle has been built.",Disneyland_HongKong

598809669,5,2018-7,Canada,"A very lovely, a very, very, hot Disney visit! Had a great day here. Firstly, it is so easy to get to from either Hing Kong Centre or Kowloon, taking the MTR. Got here upon opening and were able to get in a number of rides with minimal wait times. The park has many familiarities of the US sites, similar    lands    so it   s very easy to navigate, although The Hing Kong park seems smaller and more walkable. Rides my kid loved: Space Mountain (a different name), the Toy Story Hot Wheels ride was awesome, and of course we rode the Grizzly Mine Cars about three times. Food: prices approximate to other parks. If it is warm out, bring as much water as you can. If you only want Western food there are some spots to get this. Overall, I would go again. I was thrilled by wait times, but maybe this was just luck. There were a number of characters we didn   t recognize because they are popular with Disney Japan, but this had no impact on us. The castle was very small and undergoing renovations so it   s too bad we missed that. Parade was great. Check for weather, bring water, enjoy! ",Disneyland_HongKong
598804335,3,2018-6,Oman,"Our first visit to Disney, much smaller than we expected (compared to Universal and many others)The grizzly mine cars was good experience. Also, kids loved the mystic manor, hyperspace mountain, iron man experience, parachute drop and a couple of shows. Others were mostly routine stuff.Easy to navigate (though a bit hot   in June)Staff were very friendly , everything was well organised. The place is well maintained. Lot of greenery.As expected, food is costly (outside food is not allowed, bags are checked at the entrance).Wifi (free) is not very good, didn't find their app very useful.The night parade was fantastic and worth the wait.We took a two day pass (is only marginally more expensive than one day ticket)Better to go early (and of course avoid holidays and weekends). Still you might find some school trips which will add to the waiting time.Can be easily accessed by MTR, but we preferred to stay in the nearby Disney hotel (regular free shuttle buses are available)",Disneyland_HongKong
598687435,5,2018-4,Thailand,"Got a two day pass this time so my daughter would have a grand time in the park. I expected that the queues would be very long to every ride and every photo op with the characters. It was indeed. We enjoyed the parades the most. Anyway, on the second day, when i hit the star wars shop, I lost my wallet. I was so pissed when i was told that there was no CCTV in the shop. I couldn't just believe it. But since I don't want our days ruined, I asked help from the outside and still continued the journey until we got rescued by a friend of friend who lent us money for train fare and food. At 4PM though, I got an email from Disney that said that it could be my wallet that has been recovered so I ran to the lost and found area, left my daughter who was on queue to Cinderella Op to two nice local girls and voila, recovered my wallet which was intact by the way. With the many beautiful things that happened in between, someone unknown lent us money, two girls promised to take photos of my daughter with Cinderella in case I don't come back right away, a lady gave me discount coupons for items I want to buy and so on...I paid back good deeds by paying their items and food. The wallet that was returned was so unexpected! For me, that was magical.So there, Disneyland Hongkong is among the happiest place on Earth and is magical. ",Disneyland_HongKong

When you factor in the lines, I don   t think anyone can go through the whole park in one day. We saw maybe a third of it. We were at Disneyland for about 6 hours.The food here is highly overpriced. The shops were crowded, but nice for AC. The bathrooms were a bit dirty. The toilets are on the ground (which is good for boys).There were a lot of rude tourists (adults and kids) who appear to be in a rush and were pushing a lot.Overall, it was worth visiting once. I may or may not go back when my son is older, more patient, and can protect himself from the tourists who push. FYI: I asked them at the gate....

Entry seems to be a very muddled affair with none of the gates moving fast, however when you are in everything works well.They open the different lands at different times which seems very strange. The Mystic Manor is definitely well worth going into.The park has the magic of the Disney parks and is well worth going to. I really am at a loss why you would need 2 days there, but I guess if you have small children it takes a longer to get from place to place.Plenty of different food options to choose from with a good mix of Asian and Western to choose from (prices are Hong Kong Prices so expensive).The parades get very crowded so well worth picking a good spot in the shade before it starts.",Disneyland_HongKong

The park has a lot of repackaged rides areas from Disneyworld and Anaheim Disneyland, which was fine but nothing new. The best rides that are relatively novel to Hong Kong are Iron Man and Mystic Manor (the best, obviously). My favorite part of the whole park was actually the shows, which were really well done and blended Cantonese and English in a very accessible and interesting way. Definitely try to catch the Jedi Training  it was hilarious and great. The shows were the most identifiably  Hong Kong  part of the park, so they were really memorable for me, as a westerner.

As you would expect, terribly overpriced food which was really ordinary (although the bakery food was pretty good) and only 2 rides which would appeal to real thrill seekers. But the parades were fun to watch, the place is beautifully clean (unlike Disneyland Paris) and a pleasant day if you've got little ones.",Disneyland_HongKong
595276758,2,2018-7,Barbados,"Although I read the reviews prior to going, I still wasn't expecting the park to be that small. The first disappointment was the 'fake' train station building. It looked like a backdrop from a cheap play made out of canvas. Main Street was less than 5th of the length than it's counterparts, and castle (although surrounding by hoarding), looked no higher than your tallest basketball player! Many of the food establishments were closed, although what i eat eat was very good. Been to many Disney Parks, and this was by far the worst...really not worth they money they're asking for.",Disneyland_HongKong
595216501,5,2018-7,United States,"After a stressful and chaotic trip to Shanghai Disneyland, my teen and I actually dreaded this trip to Hong Kong Disneyland, but it was prepaid so we tried. I am SO glad we did. We arrived in the afternoon on a Friday and decided to get in a half day at the park. We were pleasantly surprised by the lack of a crowd. We immediately noticed the friendliness of the staff and the smiles which were not common in Shanghai. The staff gave stickers and really tried to help us in English when needed. The crowds were well behaved and I was not pushed once all day!!!! Even the parades and the projection show were fun, orderly and well managed by the staff. Shanghai Disneyland could learn a lot from Hong Kong. The park is small and the castle was closed which made it feel smaller but it was so clean and happy that we really enjoyed ourselves. The Royal Banquet Hall in FantasyLand made us vegetarian spaghetti with marinara sauce that was really good. We also went to the park on Saturday and it was still pleasant with an increased crowd.",Disneyland_HongKong

Whilst there were a lack of thrill rides, queues compared to other Disneyland's weren't that bad (30 mins max whereas you could be looking at 3 hours during peak time in other Disney's). The park was very clean and we were impressed by the food options offered, much better than the usual fayre (burgers, hot dogs, chicken nuggets etc). Mystic Manor was the highlight for us, a real gem. Space mountain is slow and disappointing compared to Paris, could do with updating. Mine train was a good surprise. All in all, we made the right decision to visit here over Ocean Park.",Disneyland_HongKong

Such a shame that the  Happiest place on earth  had the saddest people.",Disneyland_HongKong

In summers do not forget to carry your hand fan as it gets very hot and humid. The toilets are available at every 5 10 minutes walk which are very neat and clean and are air conditioned so one can tae rest in the washroom. Outside every washroom, drinking water tap is available so carry your refillable water bottles. Do carry pram if you have a child. Prams are available for rent also. Do not miss the 7pm Mickey magic book show and the 8.30pm parade. The rides almost last not more than a minute. So cant enjoy rides much but the shows are all amazing.",Disneyland_HongKong

We went in June so it was hot and humid. Pack water bottles, there are water filling stations everywhere. Go early and be there at opening as it gets really busy around midday. By mid afternoon the park was pumping with people. We went on a weekday so crowds were manageable. My tip would be to do Ironman and that section then hop over to Toyland if that   s on your list as it gets very very hot and crowded over there in the afternoon and there is limited shade. Wait times there were the longest at 30mins and in the heat we decided to bypass it. Food wasn   t as expensive as I expected. It   s not cheap though either, so have a good breakfast and if you choose something like a rice and curry for lunch it will fill you and keep you going until closing. Small snacks could have been taken in, but I think anything big would be confiscated. Don   t miss the Lion King show. I did and family who had seen the stage show and we   re unsure about going to it, said it was fantastic. I now regret not making the time to see it.",Disneyland_HongKong

We went on a Friday and there was a crowd but we still managed to cover much of the park. I have been to Magic Kingdom Disney in Orlando and it took us 2 days. We felt satisfied with the HK Disney after one day because we had covered so much due to the lack of lines. The Lion King show was a highlight. The Moana show is a new feature but needs more seating as it was very crowded. Overall we had a great time and would recommend!",Disneyland_HongKong

We were finally able to do that while my sister was in town. I will start off by saying, I grew up on Disney World, so it will be really hard to top that. Still, they did a great job with the Disney here. We thoroughly enjoyed it. While it wasn't close to Disney World, it was close to being there. They did a nice job with Tomorrowland. The show we saw was incredibly inclusive. It performed the songs in English. The dialogue was in Cantonese with subtitles on either side in English and Mandarin. Prices were Disney prices. Everything was pretty expensive, but that is the way Disney is. The parade at the end of the night was a lot of fun. Exiting the park was incredibly easy with the MTR stop right there. The kids especially loved the special MTR for the Disney Land. It is worth seeing, but if you've done Disney before, I would maybe suggest checking out Ocean Park. It is unique to Hong Kong and has pandas!!",Disneyland_HongKong

My boys had an awesome time. one day does not seem enough especially if you have kids (toilet breaks nap break icecream break exploring break).

591857578,3,2017-7,India,"The trip to HK Disneyland was a blend of good and bad experiences. Firstly it's a bit expensive travel to and fro in MTR form Hong Kong or Central station to Disneyland. The entry ticket pass is also expensive. The only recommendation I would give is if you have been to any other disneyland's in the world or especially paris, skip this one for sure. There's no need to waste your time, money and a whole day for this place. I have been to another 3 disney's including paris and I am telling you from my experience. It is seriously not worth it. If you have kids who are under 15 then you can surely opt a day out in disney but if you are traveling adults or teens like me in early 20's then it's a strict no. They don't have any thrilling rides for adults or teens. Though the whole idea behind creating a disney park is for children but they should keep in mind that children are not the only age group that visit. Besides it is so packed and flocked. The queues and waiting times are very long and lengthy. There's not much seating space with shade. The food and drinks in the disney are way too expensive. Not much choices for vegetarians. The Ocean Park is a very good alternative for Disneyland. You can choose Ocean Park over Disneyland on any given day and you surely won't regret it. Kids will surely love disneyland but not all age groups I am afraid. The evening lights in the park are very pretty.

It was just not quite    on pointe    and lacked some of that    Disney Magic   . Small things were out of place... for example some of the lights not working and the rain chains not lying correctly in the rain forest scene in    it   s a small world   , a maintenance man fixing a gate that was not even being used (with all his tools on the ground in front of him) in the line of    Ironman Experience    while visitors were walking by to ride and the majority of the non performing cast members looking like they hated their jobs   no smiles.We were looking forward to seeing the new Moana show but the venue is absolutely ridiculous. Only three rows of seats in an area that could accommodate a lot more and not much shade cover so unless you got the seats, you had to stand in the hot sun for 20 minutes to watch. That made the entire show very unenjoyable and was a real downer. The kids hated it and said it was the worst part of their day. It   s seriously just seemed like Disney took the cheap route to create a new entertainment item.Also, we did not see it posted anywhere, not even on the Disneyland app, that they now close the rides in the back of the park one hour before closing time    We wasted time walking to the back of the park to ride some of those rides again and we would have changed our evening schedule had we known they would close early. We used to love riding the Mine Cars in the dark before the park closed.My sister was visiting us and is an avid Disney fan. She said,    No wonder no one comes to this Disneyland. The park is not open enough hours to get your money   s worth, they close some of the rides early and there is not a lot of shade cover compared to the other hot location, Walt Disney World in Florida.

Hong Kong disneyland is smaller in comparison to the other Disneyland but it is just as magical, with shows happening all around the park all day long and characters walking the streets. We had a suprise while attending shows when us Americans (being only english speakers) were greeted with bilingual shows! We found this quite entertaining. We went to this park in November so everything was decorated in a Christmas theme and they even had a Christmas parade and a wonderful (fake) Snowfall!!! My friends had been missing our snowy winter weather at home so this was a fantastic surprise when loads of snow was shot over the crowd with flashing Christmas lights and festive music.Would definitely recommend visiting the Hong Kong Disneyland to people of all ages as it is truly the happiest place on earth!

However, water at   3 a bottle was fairly steep.There was some renovation taking place at the laughably small castle which hampered some of the space in the park.Staff were all friendly and courteous throughout. An area for improvement would be the types of badge they give you in entry needing variety (other Disney parks have    just married   ,    Birthday    etc).Having been to an animation academy before at a different Disney, we were pleased that this was available here too. While the classes say they are only in Cantonese, don   t be put off as it   s easy to follow, great fun, and they do throw in a few English explanations along the way.Very easy to get there via HK metro   there   s a special Disney line which takes you the last part of the way.

This was our first visit to Hong Kong Disneyland and we opted not to stay onsite, but the park is so calm, that we really did not need to.From our hotel in Mongkok, the MTR ride to the park was only about 30 minutes. We lined up for entrance and it moved pretty fast. We never needed to use a fastpass and we were able to ride everything we wanted to. The cast members were also very helpful and we just had a great time. This is the only park in the world that is not as busy as other Disney parks, but I think that will change soon with the new castle and the new additions. Mystic Manor was our favorite ride, but Hyperspace Mountain was a close second.",Disneyland_HongKong
589615868,4,2018-6,Malaysia,"Took our 2 year old boy to Hkg Disneyland for his birthday. Choosed Hkg as this was the nearest in terms of flight time from KL, was worried he wouldnt take to kindly to being strapped down to his seat, going was stressful but coming home was easier as he slept throughout his flight. One thing i discovered was in order to take loads of pix with Mickey and gang, best place is to dine in one of theyre restaurants where makes they make scheduled appearances, taking photos with Disney characters in Disneyland itself entails a long queue. Staying in Disney hotels was also a treat. Travelling to and from Disneyland and even to the city was easy as they had frequent free coaches. Going a week before the holidays, and on a weekday, queues for the rides were fast and short. Be prepared to spend though as the Disney Resort Hotel, all day tickets, foods and gift shop items are not cheap. All in all it was an enjoyable experience and my kid had a blast hugging and kissing Mickey and gang, not to mention mummy and daddy had a jolly good time to. For parents worrying abt strollers, they hv the Disney strollers. Dont forget to download the app as its quite informative, indicates kids rides suitability according to height and also general info like where to find what rides, shops and restaurants etc.",Disneyland_HongKong
589606789,4,2018-6,Australia,"Hong Kong Disneyland is a great day out for families, however would recommend not going there on an extremely hot day, which we did, very little shelter from sun unless you enter the souvenir shops of which there are plenty and as can be expected packed with shoppers. Even the shows di not have enough seating to watch it appeared to us as we only saw a few bench seats at the front. However still a good day out.",Disneyland_HongKong

We got some fast passes given to us by our hotel (Disney Explores Lodge) which came in handy as the crowds increased around lunch time. Loved all the rides we went on, staff all kind, food was average, just what you would expect. Brought out the kid in all of us.. ",Disneyland_HongKong
589390579,5,2018-6,Philippines,"we thought one day is not enough, but, surprisingly, it was! Disney Hongkong is apparently the smallest Disneyland in the world, so one day visit is just enough. the happiness from my 5 year old faces seeing buzz, woody, donald and the rest of the disney characters was truly priceless!!!we didnt have any problems going to the place due to a very accommodating tour guide!",Disneyland_HongKong
589376696,5,2018-6,United Kingdom,"We went on MTRand caught Disney Resort train which takes you straight there. Train has mickey windows and statues inside. The handles above are even mickey shaped! They sell a reduced ticket for over 65   s so worth remembering. It is a lovely park although the castle was being renovated. There are 7 lands to visit in all and shows, parade and evening parade. It is smaller than California disney but well worth the visit. Food is quite expensive like all theme parks but you can take your own. So easy to get there...we had a great day",Disneyland_HongKong
589374511,3,2018-6,Malaysia,It was extremely hot weather in June so avoid summer time.The place is small so it is manageable for family with young children.Go straight to Fantasyland if your kids are below 6 so you can go for most rides.The night parade was worth to watch but a bit disappointed that we didn't get to see any Disney characters walking about for photo taking.Castle is also closed so no fireworks at night.,Disneyland_HongKong
589365081,5,2017-7,Indonesia,"Maybe this attraction prefer to kids. So many kids attraction at here. So after we see disneyland, we promise if we have children this place must be visited again. Easy acces from kowloon. Just get mtr to this place near from airport. Prefer go to this is weekdays. Big place and great experience. One day i think is not enough for around here. There is no masjid (mosque) so little bit difficult for moslem to pray. Every area have greatest show. We only get micky mouse show and very very great. We are very excited and so professional. Foodcourt have halal food. Buy ticket by online is better than on spot. Closing ceremonial is the best show. Thank you",Disneyland_HongKong
589248429,4,2018-6,India,"Check the weather before you go, if it   s raining, you won   t see many characters outside. The outdoor ride close, just indoor options available. A really pleasant surprise was on the 2nd day, the staff at the MTR told me the park may be closed due to the rains, while I bought the tickets. If you still decide to go, we did on both rainy days as we had a 2 day pass, take a rain coat  umbrella. Or pay HK $70 to buy one at the park.Lot of walking to do, plan your visit and what you want to do before you get there. This way you will finish off all that you want, before exhausting yourself and most importantly if you have kids. It can get really hot and humid!My little girl is a princess maniac and the experience of meeting Snow White, Elsa, Sophia, Tinker Bell, Moana was quite phenomenal. I loved the way the characters interact with kids making it a truly memorable experience. If you are looking for A particular character, make sure you check if they are on schedule the day you   re going. E.g. Elsa, we went on Tue and Fri and we could meet Elsa only on Fri. They have fixed timings, so planning will certainly help.The shows are good too, Lion King, Moana, etc. Plan 30 mins per show, minimum. The night parade is awesome, I see kids fascinated by the light show and characters.Food is good, lot of options available. If you have the 2 day pass, make sure you have the eTicket handy the 2nd day, even if you   ve registered with you finger print.Pretty easy to get there via MTR.We   ve been to the one in Paris, this one though smaller definitely packs a punch. With kids or not, you can complete in one day provided you get there early. Happy Mickeying!! :)",Disneyland_HongKong
589220822,5,2018-6,United Kingdom,"I had purchased my park tickets from a travel agent a few days prior, this meant less queuing at the park, it was also cheaper than buying direct, I got this in Tai Po but am sure most travel agents will be able to help.Arrived early Via a 2 buses from Sha Tin, the transport links are brilliant and well signed, We arrived before the park opened so near the front of the que and saw Mickey and Minnie greeting people before the gates officially opened. The park its self is smaller than the others I had visited (Paris and Orlando) but still plenty to do. Lion King Show was a highlight and we saw this twice. With the help of some good fortune Fast passes and single rider queues we managed to get on 11 rides see 2 shows one twice and meet 3 characters so if you plan your day well it   s easy to see a lot of the park in one day, which is not really possible is any of the others. The Space mountain now a Star Wars ride was really well themed, the Avengers part of the park was also very well done with the iron man ride a nice little attraction, but very similar to the Star Wars rides in other parks. The Mickey Mouse celebration projector show was first class and well worth the wait. Couple of Negatives for me, the Castle was closed which we knew about but obviously takes away the famous photo opportunity, also the iPhone app and the Website showed different times for the park closing which also meant it showed the wrong time for the parade, this left me sat on main street an hour longer than I had hopped.But overall a very enjoyable park with some very fun rides, it is most certainly is the happiest place on earth.",Disneyland_HongKong
589094833,4,2018-6,United States,"So, it   s not to the caliber of the original but it is a nice park. Smaller than Anaheim Disney but with a smaller and quite reasonable price tag. Second day ticket is a fraction of the cost of day one. Lines were 20 30 minutes on a Saturday unheard of at other Disney locations.Like the other Disney parks the castle and several other areas are being brought into the 21st century so expect some closures. If your a Disney fan make the stop. In just a few hour layover we were able to ride two rides, explore Main Street, grab lunch and see more than half of the parade.",Disneyland_HongKong
589056529,3,2018-5,Brunei,It was a bit disappointing as the Cinderella castle was under renovation and we didnt get to see the fireworks. The park was smaller than we had imagine it to be. Rides weren't that many either. Good thing was that we went there during the non peak season so we do not really need to queue long for most of the rides. ,Disneyland_HongKong
589034438,4,2017-11,United Kingdom,"Similar to the parks in Tokyo, it's miles ahead of Disneyland Paris (which is atrocious). We got to meet Cinderella, Duffy, Iron Man, Tigger, Winnie The Pooh, StellaLou, Pluto, Goofy, Snow White and saw Ariel. The food and snacks available are tasty and we ate at The Explorer's Club Restaurant where you can choose from a variety of Asian menus. The Iron Man Experience, a ride like Star Tours, is also open now.",Disneyland_HongKong
588842598,5,2018-5,India,"It is a must do for all tourists visiting Hong Kong. While it is quite big and the walk can be tiring,I still recommend people of all ages to visit Disney as it is fun to just let go off your self and become a kid all over again at Disney. There are fast rides as well as moderate rides. For those who do not want to sit on rides can enjoy the shows. Do not miss out on the Lion King Show, Mystic Manor Show, Mickey's Wondrous Book & Phillar's 3 D show. Also a must do is the Night Parade.",Disneyland_HongKong
588802310,4,2018-6,Singapore,Pros:My second visit here. There are new attraction especially the iron man ride. There are also some upgrades and renovations on some of the rides compared to the last round I came which is ten over years ago. Food prices are more reasonable with varieties though taste not very fantastic. Queues are quite long probably due to their public holidays and school holidays and quite a lot of their locals are in the park too. Just a note that there are no more fireworks and parade of the characters. Only lightning visuals displays. Toilets there are cleaner than before and it   s air conditioned. Most of the rides are indoors which is good as the summer period can be very hot like in Singapore. Cons:Not many complaints except for the long queuing time. Worth to visit again if there are new rides in future.,Disneyland_HongKong
588779840,4,2018-5,Singapore,"It   s my 2nd time there in 3 years. This time round we found that some of the ride didn   t seem as good as before as they may have made some alterations. Example that it   s a small world ride used to keep repeating the song the last time but this time it   s just played once combined with the music. The other Pooh ride used to have a lot of pretty panels each time you turn into an area but now it seems the amount of panels has lessen and the ride shorten. Even the night parade cars are less gorgeous as the 1st time we saw it. But then we also discovered other rides we haven   t been able to ride on the first time we went. The new iron man experience was quite awesome! There   s also an iron man virtual reality game for my 2 yr old son at the store in the Tomorrowland which is quite fun while his parents went solo and used the fast passes for the main attractions. As for the other ride we tried as single rider while our son slept, it   s the toy soldier parachute drop. It   s not for young kids.. but teens shld be able to withstand the excitement and not break into tears. Also we think the mickey   s philharmagic at fantasyland is pretty awesome but then my son was a bit scare of it maybe due to the loud noise inside.. so really have to consider if bringing very young kids there. The only one ride that my son loves is the slinky dog spin at toy story land. As for the other ride that his parents enjoyed, it   s the mystic manor. As usual it   s not for very young kids as it   s quite dark in there and can be scary for them. My son is pretty cool with the dumbo ride and obitron which is pretty much the same type of ride. As for food, we think the best food court is at fantasyland and also mystic point. It   s good to go during weekdays as it   s less crowded and if there in summer, do 1 2 of the outdoor rides u wish to try before going indoors for the rest till later in the afternoon. This works really well for us as we try the dumbo and obitron ride first before going indoors for other rides like Pooh ride, mickey   s philarmagic, it   s a small world, Ironman and hyperspace mountain, till later in the day when it   s not so hot did we go to toy story area for the other rides there. Utilize the fast passes and single rider options when you   re there to save some time in the park.",Disneyland_HongKong

588642315,5,2018-4,Bahrain,Its a full day trip at the disneyland. This one isnt bigger like the US one but good enough to keep kids occupied for a day. Beautiful parade at the noon and closing time. And loads of free shows whose timings are posted and updated based on weather conditions. Tip : Can be very crowded for weekend and public holidays with 45 60 min waiting at each ride. Try going on tuesday wed and thurs. Less crowded. Also try cloudy and raininy days.,Disneyland_HongKong

It is very clean with staff regularly cleaning the park. There are several smoking areas around the park and staff are very friendly and will show you where things are. There was almost no long waits for rides which was awesome. The merchandise is reasonably priced, and easy to find in the shops. The light show at the end of the day is breathtaking and beautiful. All around amazing experience! Will definitely return and recommend to anyone! ",Disneyland_HongKong
588019881,5,2018-6,Malaysia,"Visited on a Sunday and it was a long weekend in HK. The great thing is although the crowd could feel overwhelming especially when queuing up at the entrance, somehow when we were inside it didn   t feel as bad. Don   t get me wrong there are queues and everywhere packed but probably because of the design everybody   s dispersed more or less evenly. The food and drinks are expensive but you would expect it given such location so no point complaining. The souvenir shops are well stocked with variety and plenty of shops to temp you and kids. Takes a very strong will to not spend on any item in there. All in a great place to visit, if you have kids just bring them you are guaranteed a good time here. ",Disneyland_HongKong

We loved the photographer who took our photos at the gate and later again on Main St. Her name was Harley and she made our buying the photo pass well worth it! The photo lady at the Winnie the Pooh ride was also really helpful, explaining how the photo pass worked and getting all of our photos downloaded onto the app on my phone. (She also helped me download the app and helped me sign up.) It felt so great to see the professional photos from that day and even breakfast all there, safe on my phone! I wish I could mention her name too!Although we were just able to do all of the rides in one day (we went mid week out of school holidays) we also needed a day to line up and have photos with characters. My daughter loved meeting Piglet, Winnie the Pooh, Eeyore, Cinderella, Aurora, Chip and Dale and Minnie and Mickey. Just be aware that the lines always seem to be really long for Minnie and Mickey and you have to be early and quick for the princesses (except Princess Sophia as she doesn't seem very popular at all).We had 12 fast passes for two each from our hotel (Disney Explorers Lodge) but we only ended up using 5 of them because there was not more than 5 minutes wait time for any ride apart from Winnie the Pooh and the Parachute Drop. We did use them for the Winnie ride because my daughter really loved it. We really loved being near the It's a small world ride early in the day when no one was around. I love that It's a small world and Winnie the Pooh are air conditioned. We also especially loved the Mystic Manor ride (also air conditioned).We took our own water bottles in and loved our meal at the Plaza Inn for my daughter's birthday. (We booked in advance but it was not busy.) The pork fillet was delicious. The other evening we ate fish bites and chips in the cafeteria at Tomorrowland which was pretty standard American food but at least it was air conditioned and quick. We also had the incredibly cute donuts which my daughter loved eating.We knew the castle was being renovated in advance but the Main Street photographers still managed to get nice photos of us with it. Main St was pretty much deserted about 3pm the Wednesday we were there so we got some great photos! Again, thanks to the lovely photographer, Harley!Well worth visiting, especially if you are from Australia as it is not as far as the USA.

Disneyland is constantly adding and renewing their attraction. However one main reasons to postpone your visit here (at least until late 2019) because the main castle is under renovation.

586921995,5,2018-4,United Arab Emirates,"Mention Disney, and most immediately think crazy crowds along with Disney Magic. Hong Kong Disneyland is one of my favorite parks because it strikes the perfect balance retaining the magic and charm that we have come to expect from a Disney Park while also having lower than normal (for Disney) crowds! Be sure to avoid weekends and holidays (I only went during non Holiday weekdays) when I hear that crowds can be much thicker, and you will enjoy shorter wait times, the ability to randomly catch a parade or show, and the opportunity to take it all in at a leisurely pace. This Disney fanatic recommends two days to be able to experience EVERYTHING in the park (all the rides, shows, parades and a couple of repeat rides on your favorites) but I realize that I am the exception and that most could do the park well enough in a single day. The unique to Hong Kong Disney rides are definitely worth going out of your way to experience if you are in the area and a fan of Disney at all. For our family, it was simply magical!",Disneyland_HongKong

I am registered blind and do not use any rides, however you can only have a disabled ticket and price of 100 hk dollars if you are a resident otherwise it's full priceSo it makes it very expensive day for me just to get pushed round. Luckily it wasn't too busy as this Disney doesn't do the fast pass entry for those with disabled guests either like Shanghai one does. I had to queue in the line with my daughter and son in law or they had to leave me in the wheelchair before entering line, which can be is uncomfortable when you have very little vision Most staff seem friendly, Overall good but could do better for people with disabilities ",Disneyland_HongKong

Even with the lines (mostly 15 20min wait) we saw almost everything. We missed a few thing because the timing plus we had a child with us, so that don   t help with timing.

The not to miss is all the rides and specially the little world show of dolls. Fun unlimited for kids as they get to click pictures with all the characters of disney here and there...You will need 2days atleast to cover with kids... you start and end with the U.S street there are some places to eat Its best to download their app and be on time for all shows... know how long the lines are in which ride or show... definitely an enjoyable experience ,Disneyland_HongKong

Here are my tips for you to maximise your time.1.download disneyland hk app on your phone or avail the brochures for schedules and map.  ITS FREE2.plan ahead of time! What rides you want to do. It   s a personal preference.3.finish all the rides on your list before taking pictures.

Its wifi almost everywhere. Bring extra batteries for your phone or cameras. Selfie sticks are not allowed.6. Have a heavy breakfast! Foods are expensive! Or take your lunch early or late. Tables in the restaurant are limited.7. Wear comfortable shoes and dress!8. Have fun!",Disneyland_HongKong
585983137,5,2018-5,Malaysia,"The most exciting part of our HK trip. To start off, we travelled to Disneyland in MTR to experience the mickey themed train! It was fab.. We loved it.. Even the MTR Disneyland station was so cool! Do not miss this.. If you have enough time.. Take the train! We stayed in Disney's Hollywood Hotel.. It was convenient.. no need to worry about transport.. Plenty of shuttle buses available from the park to the hotels. Coming to the theme park, alot of people suggested that one day is enough to cover the park, but i personally feel that if you want to get a full Disney experience then go for 2 days. That's exactly what we did and we still didn't feel it was enough..(maybe we were just too excited !)The park is big (although i read it was the smallest of disney theme parks). Be sure to get a map and the show schedule when you enter.. Take note of the shows you want to watch and manage your time accordingly. Expect long queues after afternoon at every ride (waiting time around 30 40mins). Tips : (1) Start off with the 'land' that is furthest away first to avoid queues. Some lands open after 11am..The best for us was Toy Story Land.(2) Meals are quite reasonably priced in the park as compared to in the hotels.. So we had lunch and dinner at the park (also because we waited till the final parade). Plenty of Vegetarian options available too. (3) If you have two days, watch all the shows, stage plays and parades on day 1 and do the rides on day 2. That's what we did..so we had ample time for pictures and exploring.(4) If you want to meet and greet characters, be in queue atleast 15mins before else be prepared to wait atleast 60mins in queue. (5) The castle is closed for maintenance works till later this year. There is no fireworks as well. Overall , we had so so much fun in Disney.. Loved it , recommend it !",Disneyland_HongKong

585792923,5,2018-6,United Kingdom,"My boyfriend and I came here yesterday and it was really good. At the start it was a little disappointing because all of the rides were shut due to the typhoon. But obviously that was no fault to Disney, it was just bad luck. However thankfully they opened up later in the day so we really enjoyed them. We only ate in one restaurant and the food was really nice and the service was quick and friendly. The shops on main street were also really good. Full of great Disney merch at decent prices. The staff there are also very helpful. Despite there being bigger rides here they definitely aren   t    thrill    rides, but they are still enjoyable, just more on the tame side. Unfortunately they are renovating the castle so we couldn   t get a decent picture infront of it but never mind. The park is also very small compared to other Disneyland   s but we only had a day ticket and we managed to do everything so that was fantastic and worth the money.

However what greeted me was Disney at its finest. The smaller park size was somewhat an advantage as we got like we ride all the rides more than once and see the shows (which do not disappoint). The castle is a bit of a let down, however it is currently under construction so will shortly be on par. The toy story area was definitely a must see. ",Disneyland_HongKong

585488713,4,2018-6,India,"Visited on a Sunday, unfortunately, and it was one of those hot, bright days (3rd June) which meant we couldnt cover too much. Wasted too much time and exhausted ourselves at the start itself waiting for the customary Mickey Minnie photo. Skip it if the line is too long and esp if you are staying at one of the Disney hotels where you can anyway meet them at breakfast. Plan the itinerary well because its no fun going from one land to another in confusion. Its much too hot, food is overpriced, and they don't accept anything but cash for most small purchases like icecream. Although they say outside food and drink not allowed, no one really objected to ours although they checked our bags. Some of the rides like Dumbo and It's a small world are really worth waiting for, but the lines for the Winnie the pooh boat ride were so long and the ride just quite repetitive. I guess you have to prioritize based on your interests. Can't cover it all! By the time we made it to the Lion King show, we were near collapse, I was afraid my son had caught a heat stroke, and we beat a hasty retreat. Happiest place on earth? No way, not in this weather. Not at all. Be careful when you visit in May June with small kids.",Disneyland_HongKong

You can cover all the rides and shows if you stay for 2 days. Besides the rides, you must try and see all the shows currently going on. The Lion King show was fabulous. Dont miss the parades in the afternoon as well as night parade as both are different. Unfortunately during our visit the castle was closed and there were no fireworks. Try to cover Tomorrowland and Adventure land 1st as there is maximumn waiting time there.",Disneyland_HongKong
585449357,5,2018-1,India,"You need to be smart to enjoy the HK Disneyland. Tips: Its easy to reach by the metro line as there is special metro line for Disneyland. Try to reach before the rope drop. Dont carry selfie stick as its not allowed. Pick the park map. After the rope drop just rush to the attractions of your choice and take the fast pass. Fast pass machines are installed on the important attractions and you can find it in the park map. You can avoid long queues if you pick the fast pass in advance and it gives you the time by when you need to come back for that specific ride attraction. This was you can save time and avoid queues. Please note that you can pick only one fast pass at a time. So plan your day smartly. Do try out the Hyperspace mountain extreme roller coaster and the Mine Cars.

Though most of the park is designed to look like the original Disney World, the Iron Man ride had a Hong Kong theme. Lunch at the Explorer's Club Restaurant (in Mystic Point) was pricey but good. This park does not compare to the original Disney World, however, it is interesting to visit an international Disney park. The cost of admission is around 600 HKD ($80 USD).

The rides were free, that was a surprise because we thought they may have charged for attractions but they were free to enter. The attractions, rides, tours, interactive experiences were very enjoyable and worth spending your time to seek out. Tons of things to do, you and take your time and sit around and take in the carnival atmosphere.The park was undergoing some renovations so we didn't see everything but what we did experience was a lot of good fun.Easy to book your ticket from a hotel from a Handy handset in the hotels or on your mobile phone.

More than the children all of us enjoyed. ,Disneyland_HongKong
583615974,2,2018-5,Singapore,"My wife and I are Disney fans. We aren   t particularly fanatical but we have enjoyed our visits to Tokyo Disneyland and are the type to go before opening and stay till closing time. Since we were coming to HK, we couldn   t pass up the opportunity to visit HK Disneyland as I had never been before.Based on reviews online, I had already tempered expectations but even then, I was disappointed when we got there. The good thing was that the queue to get into the park and the rides was so short (we went on a weekday). I enjoyed the trackless mystic manor ride. The effects and the ride experience is one of a kind and highly recommended. Grizzly mine cart was fun too with 2 unexpected twists, no spoilers here.That   s about all the good I can really say, now the parts that disappointed:I don   t see what   s the point of letting guests in 15 minutes early to the Main Street before they open up the park proper. After they finally opened the park, I didn   t expect other parts of the park ( toy story, etc) to open at 11. They also closed earlier at 730pm. The place was already so small, surely they could organise it such that all parts of the park could open and close simultaneously.As we walked around the park, many snack stands were still closed and many cafes were closed for the day. It takes away from the festivity of the place.We were the first to sit Mystic Manor and we were excited but when we got to the ride, we found the girls standing around chatting and they looked surprised to see us. They then hurriedly rushed off to prep and asked us to wait 5 minutes. It felt like they lacked a lot of professionalism. The staff were also not enthusiastic and acted like they were there because it was their job and not because they had a love of Disney. They could fake it even if they didn   t but they didn   t bother and most looked very blas  .It did not feel magical at all. The food was also very mediocre. The crowd in general was a lot ruder than the crowd at Tokyo Disneyland. I had multiple groups of people cut in front of me while it was obvious I was waiting to take a picture of my wife and they saw me. People yelling across the street for each other. Some people tried to pick the best seats for the rides so service staff had to tell them to move down the line and they looked displeased they were told to do so.The stuff in the shops felt a little    recycled   . We saw goods from Paris Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland there. Felt almost like they were given the leftovers from other Disneyland resorts. Albert the monkey at Mystic Manor is a character unique to HK Disneyland but they were sold out for some of his goods and the sales lady said they weren   t sure if they were going to continue making it again. We went at 10, left by 430pm and don   t ever plan on going back. I expected much more and had hoped for a decent experience but I feel like HK Disneyland didn   t put in enough effort to make the place as magical as it should be, especially moreso for the ticket price they are charging. It felt like this resort is just riding off the popularity of the Disney name but it did not do it justice. If you really want to go, look for discount tickets, don   t pay full price. Go with kids since the queue is so short, they can ride the rides repeatedly and you don   t have to rush there in the morning. Also, unlike Tokyo Disneyland, there   s a proper line to do the character meet and greets so you will assured of a picture as long as you brave the long queues. It gets very hot during the summer so be sure to lather on sunscreen and bring a hat umbrella. There is barely any shade there. Use the lockers to stash your stuff, you can reopen them anytime so it is worth the money to get one. Nothing is cheap in Disneyland, the only magic I felt was how quickly your money goes while you are there.I really had hoped for more from Hong Kong Disneyland but I think I won   t ever return unless they do a major revamp, for both the park itself and its staff.",Disneyland_HongKong

The cinderella and the price was kinda disappointing. Avoid renting baby strollers during summer, unless you want to bake and sun burn your baby.

583568083,5,2018-5,Singapore,"Little did I know that after having a wonderful, fun filled, memorable experience at HK Disneyland with my family including the newly discovered Advance Pass for its attractions, where you don't need to fall in line and just have to go back on your designated time. It was truly amazing that means we can save time at no extra cost and maximize most of the tours in Disney.Now going back to my review is one of the restaurants inside Disneyland located on the Main Street USA zone near the entrance   Plaza Inn Restaurant. Just after the Flights of Fantasy Parade we stumbled by accident this place as we are about to exit. And with utter coincidence we are looking for a good authentic HK Chinese food in particular Roast Goose. Inspired by Mulan anime   the interior is very authentic cultural Chinese with red lanterns and intricate furnish and carvings. The service is nice and hospitable. The ambience is relaxing, luxurious and comfortable. The toilets are clean and spacious. The airconditioning is perfectly cool. We are a family of 8 with 3 kids and of course very hungry after a long day of walk at Disneyland HK. We ordered 2 servings of Yang chow fried rice good for 4 people, Roast goose, Beef broccoli, Roasted pork belly, and a Chinese oolong tea for hot drink. They don't serve free water but the drinks were affordable. True enough the one that stood out amongst the dishes we ordered is the Roast goose   savoury, succulent, juicy, tender and fresh. Despite the flavours and spices added you could still taste the freshness of the Roast goose   and most of all it melts in your mouth. HK has many famous restaurants that serve Roast goose. The flavour stands out for any combinations and it is very delicious                     The price is very similar to a typical restaurant inside the park which a bit pricey than outside but then again it is worth it.

But over the last 13 years, Disneyland added new games into this tiny one. By now, I would say, Disneyland in Hong Kong is not big but good enough for 1 to 2 days if you have 1 or 2 kids to play with. I have been to Hong Kong Disneyland about 4 to 5 times.

582650264,4,2018-3,Philippines,"Disneyland never fails to amaze me with surprises. There are new rides as I recalled from the last time I visited  Toy Story, Iron Man, Mystic Manor, and the like. However, I am quite unaware about how time quickly skips by. The queues to the rides   almost all  took around 30 40 minutes. And we rarely chance on character greetings   only R2 D2 and Chewbacca at Star Wars. Mickey and Minnie and Baymax is always fully queued or unavailable. :( I think our whole day's worth of visit was not enough. But again, we had fun. ",Disneyland_HongKong

582442916,4,2018-5,Hong Kong,"This is our first time to the Disneyland after 13 years since its opening. I like the size of the park for it's spacious but not too big. Every spot can be accessed easily without the need to walk too far. Thank you for all the cast members for being so professional (except for one or two) especially under the hot weather. However, I would like to suggest Disneyland to install misting system in the park before the hot summer comes. It's only May but it gets quite hot already and I can't imagine how it's like in Jun Sep. The hot weather may lower people's interests in visiting the park. I remember that when I went to theme parks in other countries, they have misting system which helps cool guests down. Maybe they should consider that too. Also, I think they should place more canopies along the pathways so that guests can take a rest from the sun during the summer. I truly hope that everyone will enjoy their visits to Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong

All the favourite characters were there and some great rides for all ages. It's big enough to keep you entertained and small enough to see in 1 day. Expensive merchandise (as expected) but otherwise a really great day. Even with a lot of people the queues weren't too long. They are very good at entertaining you as you stand in line. It's very professional and runs smoothly. Lost my phone on the first ride and the helpful and friendly staff quickly found it for me. Our 7 year old said she had the best day of her life! It's just a happy place!,Disneyland_HongKong

It have more food places than atractions. If you go in a easy day you dont have what to do in a whole day.

One has to wait almost for an hour in the long ques to take a ride on a swing. your kids can get pictures clicked with the famous disney characters. water and food is very expensive inside. Even the Disney toys are damm expensive but you wont get them outside, so just grab it if your kids wants one. There are few free water coolers so you can get your water bottle refill. In all a nice experience but choose the best month to visit Hongkong else get wet.",Disneyland_HongKong
581917368,3,2018-5,India,It was nice. Especially the Mickey   s philhar magic 3d show was outstanding. The forest river boat ride was very nice too. The fairy tale garden was a very unique concept. The tree house walk was also very attractive. The pooh and the lion king shows were nice too.. please remember that they give fast track time bound tickets free of cost at the attractions so that if you come at that particular time for that ride you do not have to wait in the long serpentine queues. But they do not mention it anywhere so be sure to ask their personnels standing outside the attractions. The train at the entrance of the park takes you through the park and you can get off at Fantasy land Area to explore the various attractions there. But there are huge lines for boarding this train so be prepared for waiting in long queues in this hot weather before you can board this train. Its a small world attraction is also very cute especially for young kids. There are some thrilling roller coaster rides too. The food banquet hall in the Fantasyland area has some good indian food and also has some nice veggie options. The afternoon and late evening carnivals are real fun to watch for kids and adults.

Avengers ride is very nice with the 3d effects. The castle is under renovation till July so no fireworks and laser show. Also the Parade at 4 pm was not very big and nice. Getting vegetarian food is a challenge as only few restaurant serve veg food within Disneyland. We reached Disneyland via MTR and the metro from Sunny Bay to Disneyland is very nice.

The line to take pictures with the characters were very long!!The restaurant's food were ok, usual burgers and fries but they closed at 4pm. Wish they're open till the Disneyland closes.

I was amazed by the beauty of Disneyland. The area is so huge. The rides are free. You can see a lot of souvenir shops as well as restaurants too. Since its summer, there are lots of group tourists and locals around. Better be early or you can go late in the afternoon. Better bring water bottle, extra clothes, hats, towels too. The scorching heat of sun rays is unbearable so use umbrella if you have sensitive skin.Sadly, we were not able to see the Disneyland castle up close because the area is under maintenance and upgrade. There is no fireworks display. But they have this parade (festival of lion king show) right before the disneyland close. Overall, Disneyland is for all ages. Highly recommended it especially to the childrens.",Disneyland_HongKong

581330233,5,2018-3,Hong Kong,The Iron Man ride was pretty new and it was amazing. However what my friend and I enjoyed (and will always enjoy I guess) is The Festival of The Lion King show.

581160653,5,2018-5,Australia,"We travelled as a family consisting of 5yo, 7yo, 15 yo, adults in our 30s, 40s and 60s. We went over several weekdays and no problems with queue wait times  the longest was Parachute Drop (20mins approx) and we really should have gone on this one earlier in the day, as it is a notoriously longer afternoon ride wait.There are just so many Character Meet n Greet opportunities, it was fantastic.Do not miss the beautiful Fairy Tale Forest!Weather: Humidity ranged from 75 95% and temp 24 31degC. Some days were sunny, mostly days were cloudy and some with light showers. There was probably only 1 day we could say it 'rained'.We had small plastic bottle sprayers that we pre filled with water and left in fridge the night before  it was so refreshing and cooling on our really hot days.Another great idea I had read on the disneytourist blog, is to use small gym chamois type cooling towels. These were fabulous to have  I bought ours from Target for $5aud ea, they really helped in the warm weathet. The night before, wet the towel thoroughly, seal off in a tied sandwich freezer bag and put in fridge overnight or for a few hours. During the day as towel dries out just wet it again under a cold water tap.I suggest downloading the Disneyland Hong Kong app (great for map, character times, queue wait times the Park has limited WiFi)With two parades, three shows, an evening Light Projection Show in Main St (instead of fireworks whilst Castle is under maintenance) , approx 17 rides things to see plus numerous Character opportunities, at the minimum I would suggest a 2Day ticket. If you are staying longer, look at a Magic Access 12month pass)  most of our party purchased a Silver Magic Access Pass (no weekend entry) and we went 3 4 different days. We didnt have to rush around and we got to do our fave rides more than once or twice.The Silver magic access pass also gave 10% disc on merchandise shopping and 10% off at character dining and sone general dining in the Park (or had meal deal free drink kind of offers).Fave rides? I would say Iron Man ; Runaway Mine Cars and for my daredevil brother it was Hyperspace Mountain. But we really did love most of them. Glad we got to see Festival of the Lion King, as this is about to change to Moana show.We had 2 (cheap) strollers we left in the stroller parking area many times , no problems there with anyone stealing them!Because we went to the park on weekdays, we had no issues with long wait times (plus we tried to do the popular ones earlier in the morning eg Parachute drop) .We tried to ask the children which Characters they REALLY wanted to see eg their Top 5...otherwise it can be time consuming (not to mention exhausting in the hot sun) spending lots of time queuing up. I found it beneficial to check Character times before we left and noting down the times and location on a piece of paper, spread out throughout the day based on their 'must see'! We started queueing 5 10min before so we were in the line several times we arrived 10 15 mins from the start time and they had already closed the queue due to so many people. Mickey and Minnie seemed to have the longest lines.We dined at The Enchanted Restaurant at the Disneyland Hotel  it is approx 15 minute walk from admission gates of the Park. We absolutely loved it, we dined mid week 5:30 7:30pm and from around 6:00 7:15pm we had Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Pluto. They come separately to every single table and the official photographers come too. Their helpers will also take pics with your phone and cameras. And the food! The variety was beyond belief and delicious. And dessert buffet, (see below pic) oh wow! Soooo good, highly recommend.",Disneyland_HongKong

It was a pity the castle was under renovations when we visited, and there were not many theatre shows. No more Golden Mickey show, and the show replacing this was closed.

They don   t allow outside food and water but even when we are ready to pay exorbitant charges for lunch they provide a set Indian lunch which is tasteless and moreover we don   t have a choice . You have wait for at least half an hour in queue even for lunch !!!! Some of the rides were closed and there was no fire works on the day we went 14th May .

There are many outlets that have limited hours which makes it hard to even find a place to buy water.Come on HK Disney   focus on the experience of the guests. Don   t be so cheap. There is still some Disney magic here, but it could be so much better if management would focus more on the experience.

We rode the important rides and enjoyed the perfect weather. Get there when it opens to avoid the crowds. It's easy to get to by many transportation methods. We didn't find much to eat in the park?

580315838,3,2018-4,Northern Mariana Islands,"We've been to Tokyo Disneyland, Anaheim Disneyland and Disneyworld in Florida. This is the least of my favorite of all the Disneyland we have visited. And I can safely say, it's the same for my 8 year old son. HK Disneyland was just too small to be very crowded and unorganized when we went (Spring break 2018). Staffs were unfriendly except the older ones. Very few seem to want to go out of their way to help esp. those who did not speak the language. We were looking for a autograph album for my son and no one seem to either know nor care. Sad. It's also dirty. Lots of trash on the floor esp. the bathroom. People are just too uncaring here including the patrons. The lines for everything was just too long to really enjoy your day. Even to get something to eat or drink. I mean, the line was mostly long in all Disneyland we went to esp. in Disneyworld but HK Disney was the worst. Maybe the lines here just bothered us more probably because people around us was just not happy or friendly. Not at all the happiest place in HK!My 8 year old was initially excited to be here.... but on the second day, I didn't even have to drag him out of the park. He was ready to leave by 4pm which I was not surprise at all. He was bored or a bit in a bad mood already towards the end. There was not a lot of Disney characters around and if there was, we didn't really know nor did we find them because of the unorganized structure or program. The rides was okay. We saw Black Panther and Ironman which was the highlight of my son's day hence I gave this park a 3 stars instead of 2. Lastly, there is absolutely no grand finale here   yes, there's the electric parade but no fireworks (castle was under construction). I mean, you would think they can move it somewhere at least or arranged for something special for grand finale to make up for the lost fireworks... no effort here, really.... which is a surprise   this is Disneyland after all!! Is it? Overall, it was a miss for us... I'm not sure if we would come back here again if given another chance... At of the moment, this visit was pretty  eh ... We didn't regret it all though because at least we can say we did went to HK Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong

We especially liked the Lion King show   it   s a cant miss show. One thing I was disappointed was HyperSpace mountain; it could   ve been much better than it is.

579767290,5,2018-5,China,We purchased our tickets through Klook and printed them off. This worked smoothly. The castle is currently under construction but the rest of the park is functioning normally. This is a smaller park but with four kids we still didn   t fit quite everything in one day. We went on a Friday and the lines weren   t too bad. We enjoyed the high flying parade at 12:30 and were really impressed by the Festival of the Lion King show. My kids 5 9 all really enjoyed the Jedi training activity show. We tried to eat cheaply at snack stands   they only take cash. Overall a great experience. ,Disneyland_HongKong
579757296,4,2017-6,Australia,"Hong Kong Disneyland is a lot of fun , a lot smaller than most but packed full of fun rides a jungle safari and a great boat ride through large caves with all the disney characters singing and performing, it reslly was an enjoyable day and the disney train ride there is pretty cool as well.",Disneyland_HongKong
579707362,4,2018-4,United States,"Second visit to HKDL   Tips:(1) If you want a picture with Mickey & Minnie, they open Main Street before the park opening and they are together in the gazebo right bast the train station. Even arriving 15 minutes before park opening on a Saturday in late April, the line already took 1  hrs. Line appears deceivingly short   however, people in bigger groups want to take pictures in every fathomable combination, and there are  hidden  family members sitting on benches waiting to cut in at the last minute. You can also interact with the characters for longer than in the U.S. parks., so that's nice, but kind of painful for the people in line that are waiting.(2) Buy tickets on Klook   it's about $10 USD cheaper. Just show the confirmation on your phone at the front entrance, no need to print. Very reliable.(3) Workers do not seem to know about ingredients for food allergies (e.g. peanuts), which isn't as common in Asia as in the U.S.   so just look out for yourself and eat something safe.Overall, very fun park, less crowded than the U.S. Cute merchandise to buy   you can actually find nearly everything in the HK airport Disney Store.",Disneyland_HongKong
579572453,5,2018-5,United Kingdom,"Absolutely loved our visit here, really enjoyed being big kids. I   ve never been to any Disneyland before, so when I was told this was a small.

579568106,5,2018-5,Philippines,Disneyland is the Happiest Place except for buying souvenirs and stuffs . But I can say that this place will make you make you want to be a child again . A place that you should not skip on visiting while you   re in Hong Kong. This is my 2nd time to visit but still I can   t get enough of it. The experience of singing with the casts while they are dancing and you dancing and swaying with them. And that feeling of disappointment when you got the unexpected selfie with pluto but the camera was in a 10s mode ,Disneyland_HongKong
579555435,4,2018-4,United States,"It was definitely worth going to for a day if you have small children. The access by the MRT was phenomenal. It was well laid out, but the size was much smaller than the other Disney properties. Lines were non existent, that was fantastic. I think 10 minutes was the longest wait time, so we never minded when the ride was a dud since we did not wait long to go on it. It was still expensive, but not as expensive as those in the States. We were through the entire park on all the rides by early afternoon. ",Disneyland_HongKong
579553877,5,2018-5,United Kingdom,Very small but a good experience of Disney. We went on a Thursday and longest que for rides exhibit was about 15mins. You could prob see it all with the major bits in about 6 hours,Disneyland_HongKong

It was rich in color and vibrant in art.The other event all enjoyed was the grand parade at the end of the day.The disney chatacters were all displayed on tableau and the sights lights and sounds were simply superb.In between the two were a few rides and roller coasters thrown in which seemed regular to any amusement park.The park in itself was very visitor friendly with helpful staff, good signboards showing clear directions well maintained and clean. Toilets were very convenient and hygienically maintained.Wide choice of food and drink was easily availableOn the whole a good place to spend a day with your teen aged children",Disneyland_HongKong

578911490,4,2018-5,Australia,"We were a little hesitant in our trip to Hong Kong Disneyland as we had read quite a few reviews stating it was not worth the money. I can tell you that this not correct. Although quite a bit smaller than the American counterparts, Hong Kong Disneyland still delivers the magic. Unfortunately for us there was redevelopment of the Castle (which we knew of going in) which was a shame but the overall experience was great. It had some very unique rides like Mystic Manor which makes this place worth it. Highly recommend for everyone especially those with young families as places like Toy Story Land is a draw card.",Disneyland_HongKong
578873251,5,2018-4,Australia,i love Disneyland. the shows are world class. you must go to the Lion King show. it is incredible. the costumes are just amazing. get there early though to get a seat. i was amazed at the number of seating areas there. most in the shade too. The jungle ride was so much fun. The parade was great. If you stand near the Pandora shop for the parade there is an interactive show. It really is the Happiest Place on Earth. So many rides for all ages too. The food was priced well too. There is a bit of a walk from the station but nothing too strenuous. A must vist place. ,Disneyland_HongKong
578734203,4,2018-4,United Kingdom,My first ever Disney experience and what a wonderful little park it was. Made me feel like a child again.   Easy to get   with the direct trains.   This theme park does not need a review. It   s a great fun day out for all ages. Avoid going weekends as it can get extremely busy. we went on a Wednesday and luckily was not that busy.   longest we waited for a ride was 20mins.   The lion king show  iron man experience is a must see and the parade with all Disney characters was great fun. its happens x2. Once at 1400hrs and then last one at 1800hrs. A lot of food option and yes there is a HALAL option to.   Make your way to the Express club for traditional Indian options. Overall a good day out for all ages.,Disneyland_HongKong
578690251,4,2018-4,Philippines,"We had a grand time at Disneyland. Boarding the train with a Mickey Mouse logo sets all the happy mood for Disneyland goers like us, especially the kids. The parade was awesome, the rides were great! Only we had to queue for like an hour and a half to have a photo with Mickey and Minnie; we were quite lucky I must say for other speactators were not able to make it as the staff had to cut the queue off. We were not able to visit all the attractions in the map due to long queues in the rides and photo opportunities with Disney characters. No fireworks during our visit, we only had the We Love Mickey Digital Show. Overall, it   s always a good experience when you   re in Disneyland. ",Disneyland_HongKong
578565613,4,2018-5,Australia,"Great for family. HKG Disney is probably the smallest one of all Disney theme parks around the world, but still great to visit.

578463299,5,2017-11,India,"Yes, it's pricey but Dreams have no price tag. I'll share tips to make this affordable. Every kid deserves to visit DL once & every adult must visit DL to become a child again.Why to visit Disneyland hong Kong ?Probably the least expensive of all ( as per my understanding )Westernised, though in ChinaLovely staffMagical interaction with every character.I will emphasize on   LOVELY STAFF  again.. I'm 27 year old & staff played a very important role in making me happy. From getting me first wagon of every roller coaster to personalised meetings with the character to going out of the way only to get me polybags to carry my souveniers, Staff played a vital role. Thank you.Parades are beautiful.Rides are great !!And being the smallest DL, you have to walk a lot less compared to others.Absolutely least or NO Queues at all. Call me Lucky maybe :PWhy not to visit DisneyLand Hong Kong?If you don't care about Disneyland. Or you're quiet short on your visit.USEFUL TIPS   HACKS :Reach by 0930 at the gates, you'll be the first one to hop in.Do ask present staff at every ride for the first wagon, they will definitely agree if you're polite (at the most they will ask you to wait for the next ride).You can make your visit affordable by carrying snacks which are sealed & a water bottle too.Best rides ? Hyperspace Mountain ( Definitely for Star Wars fans & adults ); it's a small World, Mystic Manor, River Cruise ( for kids ); Iron Man Experience & Big Grizzly Runaway Mine cars ( every age )DO NOT MISS NIGHT PARADE.And If you wish to meet IRON MAN, go to Iron Man Tech Showcase ( Most people didn't know about this)CONCLUSION:Yes, I will visit again. And will definitely recommend the same to others.",Disneyland_HongKong

The staff were super friendly and when I went to collect my first time visit badge, I got another badge for my birthday and collector stickers which were a nice treat.

Too bad the Cinderella Castle is under construction but it was still a magical day!",Disneyland_HongKong
578196419,5,2018-4,Australia,"Ive visited Hong Kong Disneyland many times. This time was no less fun!2 adults and 2 kids....9 and 13yo. We all enjoyed the attractions over 2 days. The 9yo probably had the most fun though!Weekend days are much busier than weekday.The only disappointments were probably the food selection and the Theatre. The food seemed a little limited and the quality was OK, but not as good as it could be. The theatre was disappointing as its mostly in Chinese. I get that probably most guests are Chinese, but it just left me feeling rather disappointed (there are English words projected on a highly visible screen however)The highlights for me are (Hyper)space Mountain and Grizzly Gulch Mine Cars, along with Mickey's Philharmagic. Its a Small World is a nice calm cool break from the outside world.The Jungle River Cruise has to get a mention, as the cast members always add a bit of fun and cheekiness to it. And Mystic Manor is goods fun too!If you love non stop ride action, getting fast passes is well worth it on the busier daysI havent been to any other Disney parks, but from what I know this is one of the smaller parks. You can do it in 1 day but 2 would also be fun. Its probably more suited to the younger kids (5 12) but with an open mind, anyone can enjoy!Transport options are plenty, with the MTR popular and easy. Wear yourself out before your flight home with a visit, its only a 5 10 minute taxi ride to the airport at about $70HKD",Disneyland_HongKong
578185351,4,2018-5,Australia,"It is easy to see why Disneylands are in such great repair compared to most theme parks around the world   the prices for everything from entry to anything purchased inside are so over the top, this place makes a fortune with the large crowds that go. The rides, character meet ups, shows, etc are all fantastic. Just expect very long waits for every ride. Make use of the Fastpass rides offered. Unfortunately there are not enough of these though.",Disneyland_HongKong
578051478,4,2018-4,India,"Disneyland does not need a review its majestic in every sense. I was travelling with my family and all of us indeed enjoyed a lot. All the rides were fun. However, being a Vegan was something which disappointed me for the first time in my life. Finding veg food in disney is not at all easy, there are only one or two options at max available at the their various food courts. One of them is french fries which I do not like much and the other one is some Chinese dish which I do not understand. The only option left with me was to toss and choose. I guess disney shall work on this considering a lot of Indians travelling to this park every day.Please try to skip the weekends and that is what we did, still we came across 10 15 mins of waiting time before almost all the rides.",Disneyland_HongKong
578011310,4,2018-4,United Kingdom,"Hong Kong Disneyland is a single park and is fairly small but is great fun. It has some different attractions to other parks and the three Disney hotels are within walking distance. Being small, during busy periods it can feel crowded although the locals do not seem to flock to the big fast rides, resulting in shorter wait times. We went in April and didn   t wait longer than 20 mins for anything. One thing to watch is food choice, which can be limited and very limited for vegetarians. The parades were good and easily visible without the US obligatory 1 hour saving spaces! All in all very much worth a visit. If thinking of visiting for more than 1 day take a look at the annual pass that may be better value",Disneyland_HongKong
577996381,5,2018-4,Australia,Although Hong Kong Disneyland is known as the smaller park I still loved spending two days here. I would recommend to do the younger kid rides first such as Pooh's adventures as these ones have the longest lines later in the day. The two main rollercoasters were always less then 10 minutes wait so don't rush to do these. The Lion King show is a must see! The songs and performances are next level with the majority in English. The parades are also magical and even without the castle it is a great experience for friends and families. Minimal vegetarian options (although the burger in Tomorrowland was great) and I wouldn't recommend the food voucher as it doesn't save you much money and limits where you can eat. Bonus of staying in a Disney hotel is that you can get express entry through bag check and the entrance gates.,Disneyland_HongKong

They have all your standard classic rides with some fun unique ones like Mystic Mansion. There's also some very different food choices at this park which reflect the flavors of Hong Kong and other Asian countries. The park is very easy to get to as it has it's own MTR line and stop.

577208069,5,2018-4,United States,"We are regular visitors to Disneyland in California and have visited Disney World in Florida. Hong Kong Disney is smaller but worthwhile. This is our third visit. We feel it's great for younger kids as part of a trip to Hong Kong or nearby and for US Disney fans looking for something different yet familiar. These are some reasons why. Queues are a lot shorter than in US parks. Their most popular rides while we were there seem to be in Fantasy Land like Winnie the Pooh. Most other rides were walk on on weekdays. On weekends, longest wait we noted during peak time was ~30min but easy to avoid by going back in evening. We waited no longer than 5 10m for Mystic Manor and Iron Man in the evening. Iron Man, btw, is a simulation ride like Star Tours but BETTER!We also enjoyed the parades, especially the Spring Time Processional which featured different cast of characters like Judy Hopps, Nick the fox, and even Mary Poppins.We also like the variety of foods offered, a lot more diverse than in US parks. Several different Asian cuisines are represented, as well as American fare. This was a huge and fun difference to US parks. Though prices are still Disney high and quality to be expected which is not five stars in execution. Some may not care but bathrooms are important to me! And the few I went into were really clean, cleaner than in US parks. We paid    88usd for a two day pass, which is a lot cheaper than in the US. Even though park is smaller with less attractions, we were able to squeeze more rides in per day cuz queues were shorter. Though note that park closes early at 8:15 or 9:15pm. Transportation to the park was super easy and convenient via the HK subway system MTR. We took the MTR to Sunny Bay Station then transferred to the Disney Themed MTR direct to Disney Resort Area. I will review the resort hotel separately but want to note here that shuttle to fro park and hotel service do have minor areas of improvement.",Disneyland_HongKong

We took the MTR to Tsin Yi and then took the Disneyland line. It's really cute. The train, train station, and the area are all themed so if you're coming here with kids (we didn't... just adults who act like kids sometimes), it's all part of a nice big show.",Disneyland_HongKong

NOTE you can't take your own food in so eat well before you go as food is a little pricy. Overall a good experience but if you have older kids they'll want bigger and more scary rides.

Only disappointment was that castle was under renovations, but that has to happen at some point. Definately worth seeing & admission price is very reasonable for a days entertainment.",Disneyland_HongKong
575764113,4,2018-4,United Kingdom,We had a great day at Disneyland. The park is immaculate (after the parade we saw staff hoovering up the glitter with Dyson hand held machines)! Lots to do and the longest queue was 50 minutes so not too bad. Perfect sized park and the metro goes right into Disneyland.Great day had by my 9 year old and 6 year old ! ,Disneyland_HongKong
575584183,4,2018-4,Australia,Not a lot exciting if you have visited Disney parks in US but had some similar rides to that of Anaheim (LA) Park. Street Parade was good. No fireworks at night for the time being.,Disneyland_HongKong
575420343,5,2018-4,Canada,"Spent a day here and it was amazing, Had lots of fun though i   m not into extreme rides. Went here twice already but always crowded. Prices here  Are almost the same in UK more or less.",Disneyland_HongKong
575368922,3,2018-4,Philippines,"If you   ve been to Disneyland USA, this one won   t be too impressive. But it   s still fun for the kids.  Love the Night Parade.  Don   t visit during the summer months as it is crowded and extremely hot.",Disneyland_HongKong
575302029,4,2018-4,United States,"This is a tiny park compared to Disneyland in L.A. or especially Disney World in Orlando. It is well designed and has some great rides, like Mystic Manor and Hyperspace Mountain. It was my fiancee's first Disney Park and a good one to start on without being overwhelmed.",Disneyland_HongKong

575067796,5,2017-12,India,A nicely themed park. Each of the arenas are filled with activity for all ages. The only issue is that there is limited choice of food for vegetarian travelers. The themed park is such that it is not enough even when you spend 4 days. Great experience,Disneyland_HongKong
575065371,4,2018-4,Australia,Had a day in Disneyland with my wife. We are both in our Mid 50's but we had a fabulous time. It really is the happiest place. Lines were not too bad. The street parade was outstanding. The Disney Train to the park is awesome. A must visit for all those who are young at heart and a bigger must is the Tea Cup ride !!!,Disneyland_HongKong
575051252,3,2018-4,United States,"Small version of Disney compared to FL and CA. Lines were short as were wait times which was a pleasant change. We were even able to ride the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars 3 times in a row because of the short lines. Also, the admission tickets are much cheaper than in FL or CA which was a plus.",Disneyland_HongKong
575046763,4,2018-3,Australia,Was a lovely day at Disneyland hong kong staff helpful and friendly very clean place food was very good to lots of variety to choose from obviously not a cheap day out but well worth as there is not a lot of rides but still worth as i went twice shows are very good to see . Depends where you staying so may have to get 3 trains to get there the leg is on the Disneyland train cute train Mickey mouse ear's as Windows.. Very lovely day out,Disneyland_HongKong
575020747,4,2018-4,Australia,"2 days here is heaps, parades great, but it is not Anaheim...as long as you know that you will enjoy it Easy to get around, rides not busy in April, but go during the week as locals use Annual passes Fri Sun so crowds increase. Can take food and drink in, but keep it to snacks and no problems. Only downside was the staff were not friendly or happy (compared to Anaheim where everyone is friendly and happy).",Disneyland_HongKong
574955805,4,2018-4,United Kingdom,"We have done all the other Disney resorts so it made sense to do this one as well. If felt odd.....Disney but not quite as we know it.

574873127,5,2017-11,Australia,6th time visiting in 10 years. Staff were friendly and courteous as always. Lots more activities and attractions on offer than when it opened. Saw some new attractions being built so it looks like there will be more to see with their expansion.,Disneyland_HongKong
574832649,4,2018-4,Philippines,"We went here at 11am. It was a hot and humid day. We got our tickets for entrance and meals. We went around Star Wars, It's a small world, ToyStoryland, Adventureland, Fantasyland, etc. We enjoyed the Jungle River Cruise. It's so exciting we almost got wet! We had lunch at the Banquet Hall. Different choices of food. We left at 5pm.",Disneyland_HongKong
574507983,4,2018-4,Singapore,"It was good. Hong kong to me has one of the most easiest train route to everywhere. For Disneyland, there are halal stores for muslim. I bought advance meal coupon from klook. This help me save a lot. Just remember to show it to them upon entering.

574257655,1,2018-4,Canada,"I was visiting with my five month old baby and had a toddler too. I only went for rides with no height limits. We used our priority pass to skip the line for the slinky dog ride. They let us sit in the ride then because their dad was with the toddler and did not get a cart behind or in front and we wanted to sit together, so we got off and waited for the next turn. Once we waited for the first round to end, we were told because they gave out the bone tickets for the round after, we had to wait one more round. So we would get on the third round. Finally, it was our turn then the staff proceed to say my five month old has to sit by herself on the seat and not on a lap, I got angry. I waited there for three rounds and even sat in a ride cart and not one staff says a word about my baby on my lap. Then when I was about to sit next to my family and enjoy the ride they tell me I can   t have my infant on my lap. She can   t even sit by herself. They did nothing but say she can ride if she sits by herself and that plenty of babies ( pointing to toddlers and pre school aged children saying those babies can do it, why can   t mine) as if blind to my child   s small size in comparison. I asked for a manager, while waiting the staff that let me on the ride then kicked me off ran away to hide.If they told me when they saw me in line they should have said something then everything would have been fine. I waited in front of their eyes and even sat in a cart and three rides later they refuse to let me board the ride saying no lap sitting is just a waste of my time and use of my priority pass.",Disneyland_HongKong
574122899,5,2018-4,United States,"We have been to Walt DisneyWorld, Disneyland, Disney Paris, Tokyo Disney and when in Hong Kong had to add this park to our list. We were used to the massive crowds, long lines and wait times at each park. With tickets ordered online, we were ready to experience the Hong Kong version. We went on a Tuesday morning and to our surprise there were no lines. The most we waited was ten minutes! The overall park was considerably smaller than the parks in the U.S.It's a Small World ride was a lot better than the rather boring ones in the U.S. The Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway MIne cars had a twist but won't spoil the surprise! We loved the Mystic Manor which was similar to the Haunted Mansion but more interesting. Toy Story Land was great and had cute rides. One of our favorite showcases involved a large book with characters portraying scenes from popular Disney movies. Some of the songs were sung in English or in Chinese. Translations were on screens which was great. The restaurants were much better at other parks. Overall, we had a great time and would recommend if you are a Disney fan.",Disneyland_HongKong
574109138,2,2018-1,Australia,I   d been to USA Disneyland so knew this would be much smaller and it is. Extremely long (45  min) wait for 3 min ride did not impress us. Add to this the air pollution on the day we went was classed as    extreme    3 times that in Beijing which we only found out when we got home. Wondered why Disneyland wouldn   t close in days like this? Don   t buy food from here unless you have to   very expensive and poor quality fast food. Parade was the highlight.,Disneyland_HongKong
574056575,5,2018-3,Philippines,"We visited HK Disneyland last March 30, 2018. When I was still planning our trip, I felt that the price of HK619 per person was very expensive. Good thing, I made a research and was able to purchase discounted HK Disneyland tickets in HK Airport   China Travel Service for HK 530 ticket. When we were in HK Disneyland, I realized that the price I paid was worth it, given the fun & enjoyment my family experienced there. The parades were amazing. My favorite ride was  It's a small world . My father who is 74 years old had fun too. It was quite challenging for him to line up. The shows plays were great. Great job Disneyland. Thank you for our wonderful experience there.",Disneyland_HongKong

573641841,3,2017-6,Singapore,We went early in the morning however it was probably the worst time to go. I would recommend going in the afternoon and if you   re ok to skip the parade then that   s the best time to go on the rides as there is little or no lines! Going in summer with kids is challenging but no matter they still enjoy it and it   s worth it for the young kids. ,Disneyland_HongKong

The place was clean, attractions were very good, and the food, while being expensive, was very good. The castle is undergoing a major renovation, but it most likely needed it. My visit was during the schools Spring Break, so it was abnormally crowded for a Tuesday, but the cues were still tolerable for most of the rides. Toy Story Land had the worst cue times, all over an hour and no FAST PASS options. I really liked the re themed Space Mountain to Hyperspace Mountain and all of the Star Wars characters.",Disneyland_HongKong

You can meet with Micky, Minnie, Pluto, Donald, Goofy Timon, Rafiki, Baloo bear, Woody, Buzz Lightyear and others, my children were so over the moon when meeting and taking photos with all characters, this was not available in Paris Disneyland (only Mickey). Best rise was roller coaster Star wars galaxy, The Iron man simulator experience was brilliant.i went on a good day, the queues were very short. For the price of the ticket it is worth it. I visited both Disneyland and OP, they are both great and easy to get to by Taxi or MTR.",Disneyland_HongKong
573529275,4,2018-4,United Kingdom,"Extremely disappointed that given that we paid a lot of money for the tickets and when we arrived, the castle was closed due to refurbishment. My daughter was most disappointed. Advance warning would have been good or a discount on the tickets as the full park was not available. There is also no clear indication when the characters come out to do the meet and greet and often it   s by chance! Iron Man simulation ride is definitely worth a visit!",Disneyland_HongKong
573463513,5,2017-5,United Kingdom,"This is the ideal Disney for young children, (aged 2 8ish). Even our 2 year old could get on most rides and nothing had a queue so they could keep going round and round as many times as they liked. The park is small but pretty and with that Disney magic feel. The fireworks display was wonderful and a real highlight! ",Disneyland_HongKong

They only visit the park few times per month...how disappointing. When we visited the park they were celebrating the Easter Carnival and the number of guests makes the park almost congested. For every attraction, the queue is a minimum of 15minutes. We weren't able to maximize our visit, a lot has been change since my last visit a decade ago. I am longing for a friendly ambiance not the type wherein despite you are clearly in line a kid will suddenly push your kid, lack of discipline among visitors guests are very obvious.This time didn't see much of mascots except from the parade.",Disneyland_HongKong

Unfortunately, Hong Kong Disneyland decided to undergo some major renovation to the main building photo op area, the Cinderella Castle, at this time. Can   t postpone our visit here coz we   ve already bought plane tickets & booked hotel room 3 months beforehand.Even on a weekday this place is terribly crowded. The lines for taking photo with Mickey & Minnie Mouse was ridiculously long. Spent more than an hour to do so causing us to not able to go for some of the rides by the end of the day.My advice is to go here sometime 2023 onwards when their last addition (some new Marvel themed attraction) is scheduled to open.",Disneyland_HongKong
573180890,5,2018-4,Philippines,"Every visit is a great experience. It was our 4th visit and there are always something new to experience. Tomorrow land was the kids' favorite. It was great for Disney to include Star Wars and Iron Man experience. Though food is more expensive now compared to 3 yrs ago, there are also more to explore. One day is not enough to experience all the rides and attractions. Two days is a stretch and we were still not able to see everything. Tired feet but priceless smiles and wonder was well compensated. They never wanted to get out of Disneyland. Definitely a place to bring your kids and kids at heart.",Disneyland_HongKong

But if you   ve been to Orlando Disney parka in Florida and expect it to be of the same standard... not at all! This Disney Park is very small! The iconic sleeping beauty tower that is the central heartbeat to every Disneyland looks like it   s been put in the drying machine for a bit too long and has shrunk on every side! The fact you cannot are the castle from anywhere in the Park unless you   re in main street USA just tells you how small it is! If I am honest the park entry was far too expensive for what you get in return. Especially as they have now stopped the evening fireworks and there are not a huge amount of bigger rides and shows! Even worse because at the moment the main castle is under construction so is boarded up so you can barely see it even more so now! However, as my wife and I are still huge Disney fans we still ending up having a fantastic day on all the rides, watching the shows and parades and of course walking down Main Street USA singing along to the Disney music! As we went on a weekday too not in peak season the longest we queued for a ride was 20 minutes! Most rides we went on was a 5 to 10 minute wait! Perfect! ",Disneyland_HongKong
572991611,5,2018-4,India,It   s awesome. One should definitely visit it. They have exciting thrilling rides. Kids will definitely love it. There is Disney parade which one should not miss it. Someone visiting HongKong has to visit this place,Disneyland_HongKong
572821257,5,2017-11,United Kingdom,Hopefully I'll have the chance to visit here again. I was gutted I left my GoPro at my hotel. I was in a terrible mood the day I visited as I wasn't supposed to even be in Hong Kong. My connecting flight to Bali had been cancelled and I had to stay in Hong Kong for a few days. MY GOD I'm glad I did! This was amazing. Genuinely better for thrill seekers than Thorpe Park or Alton Towers. Some of the rides were truly incredible I was surprised they let 5 year olds on them! My personal favourite was Andy's race car. I went with 4 strangers who were supposed to be on my flight to Bali too   I made lifelong friends!,Disneyland_HongKong
572654190,5,2018-3,Philippines,"Went to Disneyland with the entire family and for 2 of our kids, it was their first time. We enjoyed immensely and stayed til the Parade.

Its for the inner child in all of us. This is awe inspiring, jaw dropping and all the other superlatives rolled into one. Get into the mood and become a child for a day. Does need maybe 2 days to completely see this park.Must visit!",Disneyland_HongKong
572311355,5,2018-4,Canada,We just got back home from Hong Kong. Disneyland was great but some constractions. It is little smaller then one inParis but it has lot to offer. It is just diferent. Great parades. Good was ok. I would go again.,Disneyland_HongKong

Park tickets were cheaper than the others I had been to but the experience didn   t compare to the others. Food and drink was pretty expensive too. A bottle of Coke worked out to   3.70 and an Ice Cream (Best part of the day) was   4.50. The castle was so small too which I think they have now realised as they are redoing it which is causing some distribution to the park with boards up all around it. I   m glad I went to say I have been but I don   t think I would be recommending it. ",Disneyland_HongKong

It was not terribly crowded and its compact size made it easy to get around to all the attractions we wanted to experience. Also, the fact that we stayed at the Disneyland Hotel also made it convenient. There is a Disneyland local train the connects with the local subway system, making a trip into Kowloon simple and inexpensive. Our favorite ride was the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. All of the Cast Members at the Park and Hotel were very friendly and spoke English. Being senior kids (over age 65), two day admission was less than $22 US. What a deal!",Disneyland_HongKong
572183071,4,2018-4,Hong Kong,Alot of awesome attractions and activities for kids. Some good places to eat and when the queues are short it can be fantastic. The park lacks a little bit in terms of attractions for adults. If you love Disney then you'll love it for sure.,Disneyland_HongKong

Last part of journey is on a Disney MTR. If you buy your tickets from Klook on line it will save you 8% on ticket price and will get you straight in. We went on a Monday and the park was very quite walk on to Mystic Manor which is superb big grizzly mountain which was superb walked on three times.Hyperspace mountain only had five minutes que as did Iron man experience and it's a small world and jungle cruise . The only think not so good very expensive food and snacks and not much choice at park . Also lots off characters walking around for photos .If In Hong Kong highly recommend . ,Disneyland_HongKong

The street parade at the start of the day is in one word  Spectacular  The characters and cast are really so into their performances, it makes you feel like you're watching a real princess prince  Tinkel Bell. We also once again loved the Lion King show, so colourful and energetic. They are currently renovating the Castle , so no fireworks show at the end, but the electric light show made up for that.",Disneyland_HongKong

Early in the morning and later in the evening wait times for rides are 20 30 mins however early afternoon they were well over 50 minutes. The park is very clean with lots of stores and refreshment stands throughout   considering it's Disneyland, prices were not too bad for food and drink. I just wish the park felt more Disney   no characters wandering around as they are in their own sections where you have to line up to get a photo. The parade at the end of the night was nothing special and the music playing wasn't Disney themed.There are also no fireworks anymore and the castle is currently being renovated.

Love it!Toilets very clean!Kids and adults having fun all day! ",Disneyland_HongKong
571370861,5,2018-3,Australia,Went to Disneyland on a the Wednesday before Easter and found that the crowds were not as bad as I was expecting. The park opens at 10.00am however some of the lands within open at later times. The Disney app is worthwhile using as it has real time waiting times for the rides and attractions and also a GPS enabled map to get you around however as there are only wifi hotspots unless you have data the app will drop out when there is no wifi. Make good use of the FastPass options as this can save time in queues but remember that you can only have one pass at a time and cannot get another one until after a specified time which is on your ticket. Plenty of food options available and souvenir stores and carts are everywhere. Stay for the Disney Paint The Night Parade at the end as this is well worthwhile. Get a position at the end of Main Street and watch the parade come to you. Also lets you get out of the park as soon as the parade has ended to get to the station ahead of the crowd. There were several areas under maintenance on the day that I was there however still plenty of other things to see and do. I had a great time and would recommend kids (and adults) of all ages to go.,Disneyland_HongKong
571257877,4,2018-4,Singapore,"Disneyland around the world still gives off a magical vibes despite the size! Sleeping Beauty's castle was cordoned off for maintenance so that was a bummer but apart from that, all rides are open. I went in during the opening time and I left before 3pm after finishing all the rides I wanted to take (which is the adult ish rides)Around 2pm, queues were forming so if you guys wna spend half a day in Disneyland, just head there early.Also, HK Disneyland has a mobile app which is very convenient so you don't have to hold on to the park map. That app tells you the waiting time of the attractions, entertainment, dining and shopping etc. Pls download it!",Disneyland_HongKong
571170469,3,2017-7,Hong Kong,Hong Kong Disneyland as I think is the smallest Disneyland in the world. Its very crowd and everything need to queue for an hour.

Our boys are 7 & 12 and their favourite rides were Hyperspace Mountain, Iron Man, RC Racer and Mystic Mountain. We were on these many times! We had purchased some kids meal vouchers from Klook which ended up being a waste of money. There are only a few locations you can use them and only 1 meal option at each so not a lot to chose from. So would not recommend these vouchers. There are a number of eateries at the park and the food was good. It's a great day out for a family! ",Disneyland_HongKong
571123247,4,2017-7,Hong Kong,"For our 18th wedding anniversary, I decided to keep us local and to take my husband and our 2 teens to Disneyland. In the past we've gone to Macau for the weekend. We've lived here in Hong Kong for over 10 years and had never been to Disneyland, so it was well over due.I splurged on connecting rooms in the nicest resort, and they did not disappoint. The view, the spaciousness, the service, all Top notch!We were very well taken care of in the Kingdom Club, though the resort did not cater to relaxing adult time. If we wanted to have a cocktail before dinner, we had to sit in our room. The Sea Breeze lounge by the pool was closed the whole weekend, and so drinks by the poolside meant going through room service and it took 30 minutes. And ordering drinks at dinner, including Cokes for the kids, needed to be very strategic as it could take upwards of 15 20 minutes. The whole resort seems very accustomed to a mainland Chinese clientele, but we could tell the manager was looking after us to make sure we were enjoying our meals. The sense of playfulness and whimsy about the place is infectious, so we all really did enjoy our time there.All in all, I'm glad we went, but for the price, we could have gone to Thailand, to be honest. We had a lovely time, everybody was very nice, and the hotel and our rooms were gorgeous, but there's no desire by either of us to go back again. ",Disneyland_HongKong
571055253,5,2017-10,Macau,"I visited this place with my family. The children had the most amazing time. The first time we visited was on a weekend and it was really crowded. We visited the second time and we scheduled on a weekday and it's all worth it. The parade was awesome! The floats are designed grand and costumes are really amazing. Everyone is happy!!! The most awaited part was the fireworks display, lovely. It's well recommended for families with children. Must visit during winter. Avoid during summer because it's really hot!!!",Disneyland_HongKong
571010042,4,2018-4,United Kingdom,"You are never too old to enjoy the wonders of Walt Disney. However, Hong Kong Disneyland does seem to cater for a younger and less thrill seeking visitor so for those wanting big rides and thrills at every turn then this may not be the place for you. Only purchase a one day pass as this place can be easily done in half a day and remember that the weather is hot and humid so beware! The queues are relatively small, in fact we walked straight to the front on nearly every ride but I would suggest getting there at open time to avoid any queues but more importantly, avoid the temperatures. Make sure you check out the times for meeting the characters. We were rather surprised by how accommodating the characters were in the sense that they spent a lot of time with each visitor or family and happily posed for numerous phones and cameras and various poses. We would suggest getting in the queues for the characters at least 10 minutes before but the queues for Minnie and Mickey are long so get there early!",Disneyland_HongKong
570966932,4,2017-12,Singapore,The Disneyland was true enough smaller than the rest of the Disneylands. Queue guide was good. Usually shorter than what they stated. Good for kids above 8.

570886770,4,2018-4,Hong Kong,"Given several visits to Disney   s US based attractions I was generally impressed with their Asian version. Rides stayed true to the originals while paying a bit of homage to new ideas....we absolutely loved Hyperspace Mountain, Grisley Gulch, and It   s a small world. Very easy to get around and I think they did an exceptional job of making sure the attractions were still enjoyable for those who spoke any English.Only complaints are that I found their WiFi to be very spotty and slow, which Impacted our ability to use the app, and the times listed on line lengths were very inaccurate.The folks on Disney   s property seemed to implement Disney   s traditional atmosphere of hospitality....the same can   t be said for the transportation segment on the way there....we found the bus driver to be very disinterested in answering a simple question...A good experience overall....not as good as the original but a very good representation for Asia.",Disneyland_HongKong

The evening parade is like life enters these characters and then ends with fireworks over the Disney castle!

Super small and is currently under construction.Trip not worth it. If you want to enjoy Disney highly recommend Orlando Florida Disney World (love it been there 3 times in 5 years) Animal Kingdom is great for kids. Epcot has the best food.

The place will be all packed withChinese tourists.Second, IMO, please don   t go on a hot summer day (which is like mid May to early Oct) It is so so hot and humid. Imagine waiting in line with bunch of sweaty people all day.Well, that leaves us on Nov, Dec, March and April, which you get the best weather, less pack.Third, buy the fast pass even if you are going on the months I suggested.

569904547,1,2018-3,Philippines,"We went there March 31,2018. I was with my 6 yr old child. When she saw the stormtrooper mascot she was very excited to go there. We ran towards the stormtroopers and she happily raised her hand and waiting to be called. They were pointing out children or couple who will have a chance to have photos with them. My child kept on raising her hand and we were there standing for almost 20minutes. My child didn   t want to go until she was called. But I   m so tired and so I told her to go to Storm Troopers directly thinking that they will allow her since they kept on grabbing couples    who didn   t wait there   , children who just    passed by    or children who doesn   t want to have photos with them but apparently she was turned down by that stupid Storm Tropper assigned on March 31,2018 around 4pm. For just taking a photo with my child who   s only dream was to go to Disneyland made her cry because the mascots wanted to just grab people who didn   t even    wait   ! Isn   t it that HongKong Disneyland is really for kids and they think that it is the    happiest    place on Earth and staffs should make everybody happy?! That stupid Storm Tropper made my child cry and hurt her feelings! It was ok if we were rejected because we didn   t wait there for too long. But we did! We waited Soooooo long! We waited more than 20minutes for just a photo to make a child happy. With just a click and less than a minute they can already make somebody happy but that stupid Storm Tropper rejected because they wanted those who didn   t WAIT. If we were celebrities they would allow us fast but we were not! I suggest to have a new policy with the mascots! All the mascots should have a line to take photos and everybody should have a chance especially those who    WAITED   . we paid so much more that we deserve that right to have a photo with whoever we want. Hong Kong Disneyland hurt my child and I want everybody to know it because they can   t take it back again!!!Calling out HongKong Disneyland Management fix the attitudes of your mascots!

569823535,3,2018-3,Hong Kong,"Hong Kong Disneyland is what you would expect from Disneyland worldwide   well decorated and several various theme parks. The hardware is there as it   s standardised globally   however on the soft services, I find it difficult to have rests in between rides (the wait for each of the rides could be as long as 30  minutes). Not that many vendor choices for quick rests. Number of washrooms are available but some require lengthy walks   so not the most convenient for children of younger ages. Majority of the resting seats in the parks are fully exposed under the sun without shades so it could be easily sunburned if visit the park without hats or umbrella. Majority of the F&B stops do not offer A C (but is open air) so it can be unbearable during heated summer time   do come prepared with light clothes and umbrella, hats, sunglasses and sunblocks. We already tried to beat the crowd by being the first to arrive the park, but more than a dozen tour groups arriving with large tour buses also planned the same and their stops are immediately in front of the park entrance whereas for private car park guests would need to walk further to arrive the entrance   just be mindful to wear very comfortable shoes as a lot of walking is required during the entire visit.

There is a lot of walking from one end to the other made a little more inconvenient because it   s so far and fantasyland castle is closed.

It looks a bit aged but they are obviously doing work on things as Sleeping beauty   s castle and a few other things were all closed for renovations. It   s not cheap but not overly expensive either. The rides we did go on were great and the street parade was fun. We got there at 10am opening and had walked the park and were done by 1:30 and had ridden a few rides, there really isn   t that many.

As to any other Disneyland, the most interesting part is to attend the Night Parade. There is a day parade in the afternoon and a night parade with illumination.

The club lounge is also really great with a lot of food to choose from for the evening canap  s and breakfast.

It's a good park for families with little kids, or if you just want to tell people that you've been to Disneyland.We were there over a weekend in March. It wasn't very packed but it was quite busy as it was the start of their Springtime event. Most of the rides wait times were around 20 30 minutes, with it being noticeably longer on the Saturday. The park still uses paper fast passes, and only for a few rides. They make nice souvenirs though, so you can collect and keep them instead :)The rides and shows can be done in one full day but if you want to do the character meets, it will take you 2 days to cover everything. 2 days tickets only cost a little bit more than a 1 day ticket.Iron Man Experience was interesting, I liked that it was both in Cantonese and English. I'm not sure if they had multiple versions like in Star Tours. And it really made me want to eat dim sum.The best reason to visit HKDL : there is halal food and a prayer room available. The variety of food has increased and now the Main Street Marketplace (the little snack shack in between the Main Street Bakery and the Chow Tai Fook jewelery store) is also certified halal and sells (wait for it) HALAL TURKEY DRUMSTICKS. So friends, we must support, OK?The park sells meal vouchers for a discount, and while it looks like a good deal, I find it quite difficult to eat 2 square meals as their meal portions are sensibly large. Fortunately, we had Magic Access which offered a 25% discount off dining, and used that instead.The fireworks show has ended since the castle is being torn down, and instead they do a projection show down Main Street. Mickey makes an appearance at the end of the street near the central gazebo and we love the Mickey shaped confetti.Unlike Tokyo and Anaheim, HKDL opens later, which is nice because you can sleep in.

Ticket price should be cheaper in view of the fireworks cancellation since it's the highlight of the visit.My son's favourite antique car ride was no longer available... The HK Disneyland is no longer the place that we will want to visit again.,Disneyland_HongKong
566996808,5,2017-11,India,I had been here in November 2017. I felt like a kid all over again. It's a must place for the kiddies. The parade and fire works were superb.,Disneyland_HongKong
566992906,3,2018-3,Singapore,Many places were closed for renovations. However the children enjoyed the new Ironman experience. Long waiting time for most photo shoots & rides. The park should impose a non smoking rule as the guests are mainly children.,Disneyland_HongKong
566968159,5,2018-3,Hong Kong,"I went here twice with my teenage daughters and their friends, both times on a weekend. Amazingly we were able to ride all the rides were wanted, last time even twice a couple of them. The longest wait time was 30min. This is so much better in comparison to Disney in USA where you could stand 60 to 90 min line! Note we do always come early, right after it opens so I'm sure this helps however we stay until about 4pm to watch the parade which is very cute and uplifting. The food is of course quite expensive everywhere but decent. And plenty of opportunities to satisfy sweet cravings with ice cream, waffles, churros and more. Of course there are plenty of souvenir shops to buy gifts for everyone : ) Overall I really like how this Disneyland is compact so you could go around it in a half day, no stress and no huge crowds (of course this is Hong Kong so people are everywhere still but not crazy). Definitely worth a visit with kids or even for adults to just have fun! ",Disneyland_HongKong
566949277,5,2018-3,Australia,"A great day out. Lots to see and do for all ages. As in most cases there in often huge lines for popular rides, but they do let you know before entering the time to wait before you can get on the rides. The Disney story time musical is a must see. Food was pricey. ",Disneyland_HongKong

The ride areas were very clean. The servers were very professional and very kind. It was a little bit crowded inside, but the Disneyland show was very wonderful. You should go there, trust me you will be surprised to see all the spectacular views. Anyway, it wasn't too expensive to get inside.",Disneyland_HongKong

566287043,4,2018-2,Canada,"As expected HK Disneyland is a smaller scale than DisneyWorld but it still has the iconic Disney layout and attractions with a local twist.

566272363,4,2018-3,United Kingdom,"Small, with just a few major rides, but clean and beautiful. Well organised, efficient. On the day we went, a Tuesday, it was not too busy. However in consequence, food stalls and some rides and shows closed up at 6pm, when the park was officially open to 7:30 the day we went. Also, there was a lot of construction, with the castle and several other areas cordoned off. I estimate 10% of the park was closed, so not happy to be charged full price, added to the early closing of stalls and shows. Not to Disney standards. But otherwise great atmosphere, and running smoothly. I noticed that some of the electrics on the light parade were not working, so the park could use some maintenance. That said, toilets very clean as we're the walkways.",Disneyland_HongKong
566266272,3,2017-12,Indonesia,"We   ve been at Disneyland Japan to compared it with, and obviously this was not as good.

565927863,3,2018-3,Singapore,Visited yesterday amidst great anticipation as our last visit was two years ago and we knew there were some new attractions as well as some old ones we wanted to revisit. Checked the website not much info. Reached there day started well at new Star Wars attraction and iron man show but soon discovered attractions like mystic point supposed to be brand new down Down due to technical error and Lion king show was also closed and toy story parachute ride was also closed. Mind you these are all star attractions! How can a park charge full admission when three star attractions are closed??!! This resulted in crazy queues by mid afternoon bec each ride show you can imagine should have been able to take a few hundred people off the track at each point!!! We left by 430 after the parade bec the crowd had gotten to the point of ridiculous. Sure people can fit into the park but with major rides closed this is not fair to paying customers flying in from overseas!!! A partial discount or meal vouchers should be offered when more than one major attraction is closed. Disappointed and unlikely to come back again.,Disneyland_HongKong
565786146,3,2018-2,United States,"In all fairness, we went during Chinese New Year holiday.The Cinderella castle was closed for repairs.This one is considerably smaller in footprint & variety of activities.Didn't seem they integrated the Chinese culture into the design & execution, it's very similar to the one in Orlando.Food offerings were good & diverse.Ticket price was reasonable.Very convenient transport, used MTR the whole way from Hong Kong island.Food stands take cash only",Disneyland_HongKong

565588949,3,2018-3,United Kingdom,"For someone who is an avid Disney fan this park was disappointing. It   s too western and shows no oriental culture. They don   t even celebrate Mulan. The castle on mainstreet is miniature and laughable compared to Paris or Florida. Two small rollercoasters, no fast speed thrill chasers. There were no parades on and lots of things were closed for refurbishment. It lacked the Disney magic you feel in other parks. ",Disneyland_HongKong

565511111,5,2017-10,United States,Hong Kong Disney is a must for Disney fans. It is very easy and inexpensive to get there by subway and to transfer and ride the special disney train is a delight and it stops at the front gate. This park is much cheaper than the parks in the U.S. and senior citizens get even a better deal.,Disneyland_HongKong
565345077,4,2018-2,United States,"Went with family during Lunar New Year week and was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't too crowded. Didn't wait for more than 30 minutes for any of the rides. I kept hearing how it is smaller than other Disney's around the world but it had enough rides and attractions to enjoy for a full day. We went when it opened in the morning and stayed until the very end of the parade and was not bored. Also loved the fact that we were able to take photos with Mickey and Minnie dressed in Chinese costumes, although had to wait in line for almost an hour for that.",Disneyland_HongKong

565243020,5,2017-11,Isle of Man,"Loved, loved this park. Can easily get round it in one day and had rides that no other Disney park does   just a shame Mistic Manor wasn   t open.  If you are in Hong Kong and like Disney, this is a must!",Disneyland_HongKong
565166126,4,2017-10,Australia,"It   s Disneyland ! Though compared with the LA or Tokyo ones the Hong Kong Disneyland is a much more scale down version ; with a smaller park area. However it works perfectly when you have a younger child as it is not as tiring for younger kids. The lines were not as crazy compared to the bigger parks in LA and Tokyo . We had been able to try out most of the rides even though we start our day about noon and the park closed much earlier compared to the other countries. As we stayed at the Disneyland hotel , it was just an easy stroll or shuttle back to our room after a long tiring day out at the theme park. ",Disneyland_HongKong
565053633,3,2018-2,Philippines,I last visited HK Disneyland 3 years ago and I already noticed the changes before. It was not as happy as before compare it 10 years ago when my wife and I visited. I missed the time we first visited where in people are all smiles and very helpful. That you can ask anybody anything about the park and they are all smiles and happy to help you. Disneyland HK has evolved into a commercialize theme park.,Disneyland_HongKong
565044655,4,2018-2,United States,"This Disneyland, is very similar to others, but it is on a smaller scale. Having been their twice, both on relatively crowded days, we still only spent less than 6 hours there, including lunch to cover most of the popular rides and attractions. Of course we could have stayed longer if we wanted to hit every ride, but because of the relatively smaller footprint and repetitive attractions from other parks, we spent most of our time checking out those things that might be a little different. Food is not very good at all, from any of the three restaurants we tried. It is still a great place to go, but don't expect to be wowed by the experience if you are Disney veteran. ",Disneyland_HongKong
565015950,5,2018-3,Singapore,"The tickets for Disneyland seems to increase. Rides there are more for children. The roller coaster are not scary as well. I like Grizzly Bear and RC racer.

It's smaller than the one in Tokyo as well.",Disneyland_HongKong
565003137,3,2017-11,Australia,We went here late last year and I was a little disappointed when realising the park only really caters for young kids. My family and I are all above 16 years of ages and found we just got really bored instead of having fun.,Disneyland_HongKong

Very manageable in a days trip with queues at again a length that younger children can cope with. The rides are great and varied.

564538744,5,2017-9,Philippines,Not as big as expected but will definitely consumed your entire day. You'll definitely feel young the moment you step foot on this place. The place will channel the inner child in you. :) Every rides attractions will stop during the parade and will resume operations after. Do not miss the fireworks show too.Expect the food and even the smallest item in their gift shops to be pricey. You cannot bring outside food snacks inside the park.

We worked our way from F Land to Toy World, kids go nuts. Then went through Wild West where Grizzly ride is. Tarzans Tree Touse was ok., to get there was a short trip over canal. Not alot of eateries no Down Town Disney here. Small World was really good. Queuing for the River Cruise was frustrating, different entry lines different languages English line took the longest. 1 hour not worth it. Looking forward to our next Disney.",Disneyland_HongKong
563138984,4,2018-2,United Kingdom,"My 4 and 6 year old children love Disney so where better than the happiest place on Earth. My 4 year old is 102cm exactly so we were still able to get on quite a few rides. HK Disneyland is incredibly easily accessible via MTR with a Mickey themed MTR train. But this time we chose to drive and it costs HKD220 to park the car for the day. The roads were very easy to navigate and the car park was near to empty, arriving at noon we parked in bay 5. The park was quite quiet and we had to wait no longer than 30 minutes for the rides which was perfect for us. We didn   t plan our day very well and missed the lion king show but were able to catch all the other shows. Even though HK Disneyland isn   t very big we still didn   t have enough time to get around all of the park. We missed out Adventureland. The rest of the park was well thought out, well presented and easily accessible. The toilets were well placed throughout the park. They were all clean with toilet paper and hand paper was available (locals will know this is rare!). There was also a choice of regular toilets or squat toilets. Every toilet we visited had baby changing facilities. We knew in advance that the fireworks had been cancelled so we weren   t disappointed. We used the time to go on extra rides until the park closed at 9pm. As with any Disney attraction the food was mediocre and incredibly overpriced. We still had some snacks from the many food stalls and also ate the set dinner at the Plaza Inn. The part that made the day really special for us was that my 6 year old was approached by a staff member to take part in the princess parade. For this she was sat in a prime seating area (only one parent was allowed to accompany her) to watch the parade and join in the dance with the Disney princess float. It truly made the visit memorable. Thank you Disneyland HK for making our visit so special!",Disneyland_HongKong
562958373,5,2018-2,United Kingdom,If you have ever been to Disneyland Paris it is the same but a shrunken down version. The good thing about this is that you can do basically everything in one day.

We arrived at 930 and had no delays getting into the park.if you can buy (fast pass easy pass) tickets already along with your entry. Yes a little more money but well worth it. Every body has there own likes but the iron man and Star Wars rides are great. Even some of the rides shows that we weren   t really interested in , we went on(because of fast pass tickets) and surprisingly we enjoyed them. At around lunch time  1oclock it starts to get really busy, so be prepared. Food stalls and seats become very busy.

They also hiked up the ticket price starting January 2018.During our stay, 2 of the attractions that we went to malfunctioned so they had to close it for about an hour or so. Picture taking with Mickey & Minnie also have specific timings and they cut it short very early (around 4:00 or 4:30 PM). I could be wrong but I don't remember them closing it before 4PM on my previous visits few years ago.Don't get me wrong.... Disneyland is still a very fun place to visit in Hong Kong.

The attractions are mostly geared toward smaller children but the park is well maintained and easily do able in a single day if you use FastPass. (You get 3 Fast Passes with a general admission ticket). The Lion King theater show was particularly good. Best of all, a regular ticket is about $75 US, and if you are over 65 it is about $13 US.

561114590,4,2018-2,Indonesia,"I'll start by reminding you that all Disney properties are clean, efficient, well maintained, family freindly, staffed by friendly and helpful people, and have lots and lots of Disney magic. All that being said, I found Disneyland Hong Kong to be my least favorite of the four I've visited. Maybe my expectations were a bit too great, but I found that it's a little small feeling, and it seems like there are fewer attractions and definitely fewer shows than other Disney properties. The things that they do have are really good, but we were pretty well done before the sun went down on our one day visit. If it's your only Disney opportunity, definitely go. If you love Disney definitely go. Just know what to expect.",Disneyland_HongKong
561064503,4,2017-10,United States,"We've been to both Orlando Disney and Tokyo Disney and had heard that Hong Kong was no match for either of them. We went into the park with low expectations. There were definitely some downsides to the park, but for the most part, we left feeling pleasantly surprised. THE RIDESAll the rides are super fun and innovative, and even the big ones have short lines (30 minute wait at the VERY most, but usually 10 minutes). They are exciting enough for the older ones (my teenage granddaughter loved all the rollercoasters, the new Iron Man simulator, and the Mystic Manor trackless ride  so did my 40 year old children, in fact!) but also appeal to the younger ones and have low height restrictions so my 5 yo granddaughter was able to ride EVERYTHING in the park (a first for her). THE SHOWSWe watched a live performance of Mickey and the Wondrous Book. The visuals were stunning, performances were great. Tiana stole the show with Almost There, but I must say that Elsa disappointed with Let it Go, the performer was NOT a strong singer. The dialogue was in Chinese but with English subtitles. THE FOODMeh, especially for the prices  although you MUST try the caramel popcorn! Meal vouchers are a good idea and saved us 12 bucks (USD) and we got 3 vouchers for caramel popcorns with the meal vouchers. I recommend eating at the Explorer's Cafe. THE SERVICEAlso meh, especially after having visited Tokyo Disneyland and WDW in Orlando. People did not go out of their way to assist us as in the other Disney parks. Other guests were visibly cutting in line but the Cast Members turned a blind eye. Overall, it's definitely worth a trip. If you go in the off season, you'll experience short lines and be able to do the entire park easily in a day.",Disneyland_HongKong
560956841,4,2018-2,Russia,"We have been to this Disneyland twice. So, tried all adventures for adults and for babies this time. To sum up: our daughter loved it very much and didn   t want to leave. There is a wonderful attractions for the children of 1,5 4 years as fantasy land, Pooh   s house, orbitron, jungle cruise and many others. A lot of interesting small spots to discover fairy tails. So, if you have children below 6 years old they will love it. For adults I would recommend to visit Ocean park, it if more interesting. Also I would like to note, that it is quite hard to buy healthy food for the baby on the territory of park, we have seen mostly sweets, cakes, etc. so it is better to take something with you. It will be great if some healthy food cafe will appear in the park. Most part of visitors are from China, though all attractions are mostly in English. ",Disneyland_HongKong
560829232,5,2018-2,India,"The dilemma:Whether to take the two day pass or one day pass? Looking at reviews feedback, I took one day pass. In hindsight, it was a wrong decision. I went with a 8 year old kid and her pace is not the same as mine. With a 2 day pass, I could have covered all the rides in a relaxed manner. The cost of two day pass is only little bit more than one day pass and it is a good deal.Positives:  Paint the night parade is superb.  This was my first Disneyland trip. I realized that Disneyland is not about high tech rides. Much more thrilling high tech rides can be had in any big city around the world. Disneyland is about carefully curated fantasy. It is not to be rushed through but savoured slowly. The 19th century USA ambience is created beautifully with attention to details. Roaming through these does not need any queue.  Once paint the night parade is over, one can return to city by MTR or taxi. There are folks at taxi stand (possibly Disneyland staff) who really help.Negatives:  I wish some people could have taken things a bit more easy. It should not be about ticking away a bucket list of rides, cutting queues, covering most rides in minimum time. I can understand the excitement of kids but I cannot understand the impatience of parents. Why create the unnecessary scarcity mentality?",Disneyland_HongKong

While the place is quite small compared to other Disneyland resorts I've been to (not to speak of the huge Walt Disney World in Orlando!), it is still one of the most entertaining (but not relaxing!) places in the world. The rides are fun, the shows are great, the characters mascots are lovely, the staff are friendly, the amenities are very good, the parades and fireworks display are mesmerizing, etc. Two or three things, however, are quite disappointing in this place: first, the unbearably long queues to the rides and shows; second, the lack of discipline of the local visitors concerning hygiene and trash disposal: and, third, the humidity. Having a fast track ticket doesn't really help that much. You'll have to get a schedule just the same. As to the humidity, perhaps they should put on more mist sprays and have more covered attractions. As to the crowd, perhaps they should limit the number of visitors per day to avoid overcrowding, and also have more personnel assigned to cleaning the premises.",Disneyland_HongKong

559494222,3,2018-2,United States,"My daughter and I visited Hong Kong Disneyland yesterday and were less than impressed. The park is beyond the smallest we have been to. And the castle was blocked off, which was not advertised anywhere. Such a let down. We finished the park in less than 5 hours, which included an hour wait to see Minnie and Mickey. Kids there are extremely rude and pushy, constantly cutting in line, and the parents don   t seem to care at all. I ended up yelling at a few and blocking them from cutting. The food is by far the most expensive out of the 3 Asian disney parks, and the worst. PhotoPass   NOT worth the money. All other parks had photopass photographers throughout the park. The ONLY ones this park has are with characters. So unless you want to wait in line all day for 2 3 photos per character, don   t waste your money. They will also take photos with your camera or phone for you. ",Disneyland_HongKong

As usual it's expansive, fun, tiring in a good way but Hong Kong tends to get pretty, so ideally should visit it in winter. And the staff, right from the luggage check in to ticketing is pretty rude unnecessarily. So the trip starts with a bad taste but you kinda forget all that once inside. It's Disney. One tip, do not carry even a medium size backpack. You'll have to leave it outside with no proper storage facility provided. It's kinda off putting, and very Unprofessional.Oh yeah the train that takes you Lantau Island where is Disleyland is situated is dedicated to Disney, so your experience starts, the moment the train comes in. Pure childhood bliss. The train is full of Disney details and artifacts. Once you reach the station, the old world charm exudes a spell on you. It's beyond words, you need to experience it yourself.

558940615,4,2018-2,Malaysia,"This is my first Disneyland. Bought ticket from Klook for the convenience. There was still a long queue getting in at 10:00 on a Thursday. Like everyone else, we took the special Disney train from Sunny Bay. We thought we were too early when we got there before 09:30 but a huge crowd was already waiting. So we waited in line. The gate opened at 10:00 but we were only allowed into the game area at 10:30.Our first stop was the Iron Man ride. Some people actually took the fast pass and went ahead to other rides. Thought that it is smart to get fast pass for the few rides that offer this. We didn't attempt to do it. The queue probably took 15 minutes. Then we entered the special ride area with our 3D glasses. The ride was fun, one of the best, but rather short. Next we tried the Mystic Manor. There was no queue. While I enjoyed the ride, it was even shorter than the Iron Man ride. The other highlight was the show   Mickey and the Wondrous Book. We lined up for an hour before we could get in. The line was badly managed. The moment we were allowed to go inside the compound for another queue, kids and parents started running in, ignoring the initial queue. It was frustrating. The show lasted 28 minutes. The other attractions we tried were Tarzan's tree house, Disneyland railroad, It's a small world, The many adventures of Winnie the Pooh (not worth the hour long queue), Slinky Dog Spin and Mickey's PhilharMagic (nice 3D show). By afternoon, more people turn up, leading to long queues at all the attractions. Some additional information:1. Avoid the fried noodle from the stalls if possible.2. Download the Disneyland apps. It provides information on queue time and also rides that may not be opened. We found out beforehand that Hyperspace Mountain was not available when we were there. 3. Queue wisely. Sadly there are always individuals who try to cut queue discreetly.4. Toilets are well maintained and clean. ",Disneyland_HongKong

558932183,4,2017-7,India,"Well   . visiting Disney Land for the first time itself sounds absolutely Thrilling!!It   s kind of more for kids and family entertainment. It was an amazing experience for us though. But for hard core rides & coaster lovers I guess this place won   t work for u guys. However, reaching there wasn   t a task for us as we stayed on Lantau Island itself and the journey from hotel to the park was too short coz our hotel provided shuttle to Disney land which got us there in just 15     20 mins, while people travelling from other places will take more time than usual but its hassle free, MTR which is the second best option I would suggest, because while returning we missed our shuttle, we had to travel through MTR and it was a nice experience.The fountain of Mickey on a giant whale was quite welcoming. Especially kids, you could see the excitement in them watching those Disney characters. There was a live Mickey and Mini interaction when we entered and clicking pics with them which gave a kick start to the day. The rest of the rides were nice and we enjoyed a lot. Also, would suggest to make proper use of maps and the timings mentioned on it for the rides so that you don   t miss any being Sunday the wait time was not more than 15     20 mins.One small disappointment for us was the food coz being an Indian we would prefer Asian or Indian meal but we couldn   t found any options other than European food, especially after those tiring activities anyone would wish to have a meal of their choice. Also, the Indian restaurants that were shown on map were all shut and there was no update regarding the same coz it was far and we had to search walking which was very time consuming.But at the end the very famous Disney Fireworks (09:00 pm) a not to be missed stuff, is a treat to the eyes and it makes you forget the entire day   s tiredness.Over all experience was wonderful and would really suggest to visit once in your life.",Disneyland_HongKong

So better purchase any rain coat, umbrella or Disney cap outside of the Disneyland. Fast pass price has several benefits. it saves time. If you are with little kids you may need fast pass because on most of the rides there is a lot of rush. so kids either get irritated in long queues or they miss some rides. Tips for visitors:1) Avoid visiting on sundays or holidays. There will be a lot of rush. Local tourism is china is very high. Locals visit to these attractions so try to avoid visiting on holidays or festival days to save your time and visit with peace of mind. 2) Go to the place as early as possible.

It's a small world  and the  Pooh Bear  were my personal favourites, plus make sure you wait around for the end of day parade the lights in this are amazing and very good.Some not so great points: food variety wasn't amazing, there wasn't a heck of a lot of vegetarian meal options and the snacks and meals were very expensive (I would recommend taking in a lot of food for snacks especially if you have kids). There weren't enough characters throughout the park during the day. We only managed to see three characters, and we were there from open til close. Some of the park just looked a little bit tired and unpolished. Also some of the main characters were no where to be seen within the park and rides.

The Disney experience with the Asian touch is really spectacular. I'd recommend making the most of the fast pass, which you can use once at every ride (no additional cost).We were able to get through the entire park in one day, but it was a very busy day   non stop.

The best part about Disney is that it never disappoints no matter how high your expectations are set at! We took the 2 day Play and Shop package which I believe is only available online and is serious value for money. You can make the second visit anytime within 6 or 7 days of the first visit! My parents who are close to 70 basically paid only 100 HKD per person per day which is 1 6 of an adult ticket price. The kids loved almost all the rides and characters. Food options could be better but then who goes to Disneyland to eat? Get to the park 15 minutes before it opens and start from the Adventure Land side. We did that on day 1 and it worked better than the other way around that we tried on the second visit. We skipped weekends. Do not miss the parades (there are 2 in a day, both totally different), Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Manor, Space Mountain and Iron Man rides especially if you have kids over 10 with you. Highly recommend shows such as 1) Mickey and the Wondrous book and 2) Phillar magic! Its a small world is good for older people and is generally not too busy. Have fun and let Disney bring out the child in you again!",Disneyland_HongKong
556831589,5,2018-1,Philippines,"There really is not much more to say about HK disneyland. Like all disneyland, it is the happiest place on earth, you getto meet all the disney characters at randon and at different times of the day. I guess the only difference is the language during the show. So make sureyou catch the english version, althou, if you get to watch the cantonese version, they do have small screens on both side of the stage where they flash the subtitles",Disneyland_HongKong
556775046,4,2018-1,India,"Good experience. Children loved it. Can be done in a day unless you want to do every ride, which may not be the case. The only thing that was terrible was that there were absolutely no options for vegetarian food. Absolutely none except some corn. Now, if you   ve set up a world famous theme park, people from all over the world are going to come. There would be so many who may look for veg food. It   s not a localized theme park which will be visited by locals only. And in this part if the world visitors from India will be so many. Needs so more thought on that one !! But other than having to eat only corn all day the kids loved it. Please get the food variety right! ",Disneyland_HongKong

556437406,5,2018-1,Malaysia,"We travelled to Disneyland and stayed in Hong Kong Disneyland hotel for 3 nights. The first night at Kingdom club room and followed by 2 days in Deluxe room. Our kids loved the Story Telling session and Mickey   s appearance in pyjamas before bed in the club level. One of the perks for staying in the Kingdom Club, truly amazing experience. We left our kids lunch box in the fridge in the Kingdom Club. When we are back to our Deluxe room, the Club   s housekeeping was so kind enough to put the lunch box into our new room fridge. (contains our kids cheese). We also got the luggage shifted to our Deluxe room. Very convenient and thoughtful.When I reached the hotel after the park day 1, we also got surprised with 2 Mickey Mouse plush toys, a bunch of Helium Balloons, birthdays cards from Mickey, cake decor with towels and decorations in our rooms.Our kids (son and daughter) loved the plush soft toy from the    Three Magical Days    package. Our daughter wanted a Minnie Mouse and when I asked the front desk helped me to changed it, it was changed immediately without any queries. My daughter was so excited and she was sleeping hugging the Minnie the whole night.We were late from the Disney park after the Night parade and headed to Walt   s cafe for dinner. We have been provided food and table at around 10 pm without any hassle. The staff and the restaurant was so efficient and fast and also very knowledgeable in the menu. The staff also advised me about the dinner promotion of discount of $100 for $400 minimum spend. We   ve got that discount and a great dinner. On the last day of stay, we enjoyed the Character breakfast dining with Pluto, Goofy, Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Definitely a lifetime experience for all.",Disneyland_HongKong
556414565,4,2018-1,United Kingdom,We was very pleased with our visit. The attractions are very well designed and very impressive. It's very well laid out and easy to get around. We loved the characters however there should be more of them walking around because we only saw three. Only downfall is the obvious pricing.   4 for a can of Fanta. Come on Disney we paid   100 to get in you could at least make the prices better. Overall enjoyed it. Very expensive. ,Disneyland_HongKong

Who can say    No    to little boy   s requests?Off we went to HongKong Disneyland, the nearest place where Mickey lives. It was a showery morning on an unusually cold day in Hongkong when we arrived. After checking in our hotel we went to see Disneyland starting from one of the most famous street of merriment in the entertainment world, Main street. This street is well known for all who have visited Disneyland in any part of the world. For those who are planning to make a visit to Disney, this is the street where Mickey & Minnie, Pluto & Buzz and all the Disney characters perform their much anticipated parade at an appointed time where most if not all visitors lined up both sides of the street to watch all these famous characters walk and dance in choreography. Much has been published in this wonderful place where the child within all of us savor and enjoy the nostalgic moments of our own idealized world of childhood.",Disneyland_HongKong
556256700,4,2018-1,Philippines,"Very good to visit with your family especially with kids. You have to ready your shoes and feet as it would be whole day of walking. This was my second time to visit HK Disneyland and I noticed that there were new attractions. It will surely unleash the child in you. Bringing in of food is allowed as long as it is not a full meal. Chips, cookies, candies were okay. Drinks were also allowed. My tip is to buy water outside before going there as the price inside is much higher. Enjoy the day and wait until 7:30pm for the Grand Parade, It was worth the wait. Find yourself a good location to sit along the Main Street USA early as the whole street becomes full packed before the parade.",Disneyland_HongKong
556231886,5,2018-1,United States,"Well, I was pretty impressed with HK Disney. I love Toy Story Land and the attractions there. The Big Grizzly Mountain Mine Cars here is way better than the ones in LA and Orlando.The park is smaller compared to its counterparts in the US but you do only pay $70 (make sure to buy tickets through Klook). I visited on New Year's day and the park was pretty empty! Disney is working on Cinderella's Castle so there are no fireworks (my favorite Disney 'attraction')",Disneyland_HongKong

At the end of it we were asking if that was it. After lining up and being jostled around by the crowd we felt shortchanged.Staff at the souvenir shops were snooty   so why would people be happy in buying way overpriced Disney stuff we could get at lower prices elsewhere?There was no ride that I could say was super fun. And I was so looking forward to the Star Wars ride which was not fun at all   is that all they could think of?Maybe we'll have a better experience in Osaka with the Harry Potter theme park...",Disneyland_HongKong

Was not unbearable.The lion King show was great!We went for 2 days, it was enough as we had young children.Was def worth going. ",Disneyland_HongKong

556004064,4,2017-11,Hong Kong,"We took the train from Kowloon to HK Disneyland at 9:30am and we got to the park at 10am. The bag check and ticket checking process was quite smooth. The day pass was quite pricey so you need to go early and stay till they close to make it worth it. Going there early during the week can avoid the crowds, which usually starts around 1pm. Even the place is small, there are still a good number of rides to play at the park. The kids wanted to see the castle and we walked down the main street to get to the rides. Our route was Main Street    Tomorrowland     Fantasyland    Toy Story Land     Adventureland. Had lunch at Starliner Diner...very expensive for low quality food! Some people brought snacks for their lunches. Wish we had done that too.Played a few more rides after lunch and we left the park at 6pm. Totally forgot about the traffic. The trains were packed!!! If you don't have a stroller but you have young kids, you can rent a stroller for HK$120 per day with HK$100 refundable deposit. There are many stroller parking areas which was very convenient.Tips: download the Disneyland HK app to see the waiting time for each ride. It's pretty accurate.",Disneyland_HongKong
555848329,3,2018-1,Singapore,First time to any Disney Park. Was expecting it to be magical but we found the place somewhat muted.Maybe it was the crowd. We even saw a kid peeing at the sidewalk.

It was my first time I visited the place in Hongkong, The place is very happening, beautiful and well designed, the time you step you into the place, you will get into the delightful memories of your childhood. I went to the place during Christmas which made my experience better. The place is very crowded so I recommend to take a 2 day pass if you are planning to go especially on weekends or public holidays so you can enjoy the most of it. Don't forget to attend the evening firework and Disney parade. They have dedicated mobile applications which will give you an idea about the timetable and wait time on rides.",Disneyland_HongKong
555787849,5,2018-1,India,HK Disneyland is small as compared to US one but it is worth it. This is a must visit for a child(once in a lifetime). The shows and Parades should not be missed. The Iron man Experience is a new addition which should be in a must do list.The characters at Main Street looks so real and reminds us of very fond memories of the past.Travel in a weekday to avoid the queue and rush.,Disneyland_HongKong
555723927,4,2018-1,United States,"Four people three generations all adults. Love this happy place! We live in the northeast part of US. Visited Disneyland and Disneyworld at Florida and CA many times. Each time involved plane ride and long traveling time and hotel expense. Not this one. It was so easy to get to! 40 minutes train ride and here it was! The last part of the train ride (the ride that dedicated to go to Disney) was a pleasant surprise: the cabin was decorated with playful color and lovely designed seats. Never seen before. And there were rides that were uniquely Hong Kong Disney too. We enjoy them all. Even my 80 years old mother in law got onto the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars twice! I am a clean freak and all facilities plus overall park maintenance earn high my marks. It was a weekday and a bit rainy. Not crowded, which contribute to the easy and relax and cleanliness. But not happy that some places were closed, such as the castle and small world and many restaurants. Plus no firework. That took one point away from rating. Oh try the turkey by the food stand at the main street. Not as good as in CA but good enough if you miss turkey. It was 3 times bigger than the display. Do not let the display fool you. Finally have to praise all the workers. They were very professional and pleasant and did the right thing when they saw people cutting line.",Disneyland_HongKong
555700201,4,2018-1,United Kingdom,"This is the 5th Disneyland I have been to. Once again it   s an unmistakable Disney experience but it   s quite small relative to other Disney   s.I guess we were in the off season (January) but we only waited for more than 10 minutes on one ride (Parachute Drop was 20 mins), but most were less than 5 mins.As for characters there was a queue to meet Mickey Minnie and Donald on Main Street. But we waited only a couple of minutes to meet the princesses at the 11am appearance (Cinderella & sofia) and Winnie Eeyore.I guess the downside of going in the off season is the risk of ride closures for maintenance which for us included the castle and one of our favourite rides   Small World   as well as a couple of other attractions.One of the highlights was the Mickey & the Wondrous Book Show. The Fairy Tale Forest was sweet. And the best ride was the Runaway Mine Cars.The parade was quite quick (seemed shorter than usual).Don   t bother with the Disney Railroad.",Disneyland_HongKong

The place was terrific, of course: wonderful ambience, castles, great rides for the kids, meet and greets with Star Wars stormtroopers and Chewbacca, plus a parade of Disney stars. Even the food at the cafe was better than expected. I think I was expecting the staff to be a little...warmer. sunnier. Friendlier. I mean, this is Disneyland! Shouldn't they be a little less..brisk? And much more like people working in a place of dreams and magic? But dont get me wrong, they were professional and courteous. Maybe I was just expecting the Disney spirit to be really strong here.

First we attacked the Mickey Waffle, our all time fave before we headed out to the rides. Enjoy the Iron Man Ride and Hyperspace Mountain..Love the Christmas show in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle during daytime and the Firework during night time.. We r fortunate enough to see the castle in full view cause they start a full renovation this January. We had lunch at the Royal Banquet Hall and also dinner at Plaza Inn.. both are very nice and recommendable .. and also at Explorer's Club Resto near the Mystic Manor.Mystic Manor was a fun ride .. My lil girl lovesss the Fairy Tale Forest... it's a must see and go place for every little girl who loves Disney Princesses... u can only find it at HKD.The indoor show we love so much is the Mickey Wondrous Book Show...it was so great.. we enjoyed it immensely.Last but not least, we sit down nicely for our Disney Paint the Night Parade where my boy was ecstatic to see Lightning McQueen comes alive .

Need walk about 3 minute from parking lot to main entrance. By walking slowly, it doesn't seem so hard.Since I came during high season, Hong Kong Disneyland was crowded by tourist. Moreover, although larger and newer Shanghai Disneyland had opened, popularity can't be diminished in one seconds. When I'm across several popular attraction, long queue can be seen clearly. Merchandise store that not so large invaded by huge amount of tourist.Despite these, the attraction and fabulous parade can forget long queue issue. I'm enjoy so much during that time.I'm glad to see concern and priorities among disabilities. Wheelchair user will get priorities to enter attraction without should wait for a long time. Must be appreciated. My parent chose to lunch at outside Disneyland, considered most of restaurant were pricey.

Had about 11 customers waiting and only 2 cashiers and 1 cashier was checking out 6 bags of goods for a customer.

Iron Man and Grizzly Gulch were both brilliant, whole park is very clean, and you don't need to be a long distance athlete to go all the way round it, it's reasonably compact without feeling that everything is packed too tightly together.

Once we had lunch, the queues were up to an hour for silly rides like DUMBO the elephant (going round in circles??). The fastpass system they have is not for every ride and not the most convenient. It would be great if you could buy a priority pass like in Ocean Park.We did manage to watch the Festival of Light show (basically a 25min condensed version of the Lion King) which I thought was really good. I suppose unless your kids or you yourself are a huge Disney fan, Disneyland will not be much of a big deal.

Our son (age 9) got to do his Star Wars on stage and our daughter (age 7) did her princess bits.

Was fun but never again.Also did some sort of boat ride.

553448273,5,2018-1,Australia,A great couple of days for the Kids we grabbed the 2 day pass the first day we arrived early & it was wet & miserable weather wise. Which meant we didn't have to wait for any rides the only down side was the parade was an inclement weather parade with characters on a float singing & dancing as it went past only a small version of the full parade. The second day the weather was better we arrived latter & had to wait 10 15 minutes for rides at most we saw the full parade at 3:30 Pm which the kids loved. & continued on rides until the light up the night parade which was spectacular. There were no fireworks over the castle as they were in the middle of som renovation in that area. The MTR is so easy to use & efficient mode of transportation to get there & back. All in all a must do in Hong Kong with kids. ,Disneyland_HongKong
553382322,4,2018-1,United Arab Emirates,One Day tour is just enough for us to go around the park. But we were not able to try all the rides as we had started a little bit late.

553343230,4,2017-12,Saudi Arabia,"We got a 2 day pass for HK Disney over Christmas week.It is very easy to get to via public transport and the train to the park has a great Disney theme to start things off.The park itself is quite big and has a lot to do. It can be a long day with the parade around 19:30 and fireworks around 21:00. A 2 day pass is ideal as it can get very crowded and due to the long queues for rides, you might not get to do everything in 1 day.There are a few opportunities to get photos with Disney characters, but we expected to see more like in the Paris Disney,",Disneyland_HongKong

553086728,5,2017-12,Malaysia,"My first visit 7 years ago was good, but I remembered that I was done by 3 pm, meaning the rides must have not been too engaging and the place was smaller compared to the other Disneylands.This trip our group arrived at almost 11am to no queue at the ticket booths. We got our tickets slightly cheaper on Klook, but we wanted physical tickets as souvenir so we had to do exchange at the ticket booths. Oh, it is so worth it for senior persons to visit Disneyland Hong Kong at HKD100 only! Super envious!Same thing for the meal vouchers. We bought on Klook cheaper compared to buying on site which was HKD235 for the 3 in 1 meal coupons. Absolutely worth it to buy this deal as you get to exchange for set meals of prices HKD120 & above each for lunch & dinner, plus a snack. The Mickey Minnie ice cream will cost you HKD39 & popcorn HKD32 35. You do the math! We never even got to use the HKD5 discount for water coupon, as we got bottled water with the set meals anyways (if you don't take soda, coffee tea add HKD10).All the attractions were great fun and our most recommended would be:1) Mystic Manor (the only one in the world!)2) Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh3) Mickey's Philharmonic4) It's a Small World5) Slinky Dog Spin6) Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (not for the faint hearted!)We covered more than 11 attractions right up to the fireworks at 8.30pm. If u want more time for the rides & to shop, u shud arrive once the park opens. After 4pm, the queues were noticeably shorter. Overall, we didnt have to queue more than 30mins per attraction.As for food, if you have the 3 in 1 meal coupons, just head to Royal Banquet Hall for lunch & Explorer's Club for dinner. Big portion & excellent choices & taste!Have a fun day out at the Happiest Place on Earth!",Disneyland_HongKong

If you prefer to enjoy most area of the park & the rides, holidays season might not be best time for that. Queue for the ride is long and took 45 min   1 hr. But for my young son who just love to look around, its not a problem. A small tips that useful for us. If you come by MTR during the peak season and you dont have the octopus card, you may want to purchase the return train ticket when you arrive, just to make sure you don't need to queue on the vending machine when you about to go back : )",Disneyland_HongKong

The staff toys at the park were awesome and full of fun and energy. The attractions are set up well and the park flows as you walk round it into the different areas.The food was good, a bit over priced but that was expected with the place you are in.There are parades at set times in the day that are a must watch, these are fun and you get to see all the cast of the movies that are in the show and there is a dance element to it that really blends in with the culture in HK.Only thing that was a let down when we were there was that there was alot of construction going on so a few parts of ths park were missed out so it wasnt great.All in all. It is a must visit when in Hk.",Disneyland_HongKong
552771925,4,2017-11,United Kingdom,"We had a great day at Hong Kong Disneyland, so much fun for all ages. The park was easy to get to, on the Disneyland line. Although smaller than the European and American Disneyland, there was plenty of rides, shows and attractions. We hardly had to queue for a ride all day, the most we queued was 20 minutes! Which I   m sure is unheard of at some Disney Parks!The light parade at night time and firework display were brilliant. Great day out!",Disneyland_HongKong
552763761,4,2018-1,United States,"If you can only spare 1 day to visit and have young kids in tow, this Disneyland couldn't be more perfect. With a footprint much smaller than the Anaheim or Orlando locations, even the furthest more points of the park are no more than a 20 25 minute walk from each other, even with a tired child in tow. We had heard from friends who are Disney enthusiasts that the rides at the HK location had more advanced technology (ergo would be funner) than their much older cousins in Anaheim and Orlando. This was not the case   we discerned no difference between HK and the Orlando location, the latter of which we had visited only 3 years earlier. The smaller scale of the park is best reflected in Main Street (considerably shorter than Orlando) and the diminutive  Magic Castle  (w a much smaller size compared to Orlando) almost made me laugh out loud. In any event, there was plenty to do and despite making use of all three (3) of the park's  fast passes , we literally found ourselves hurrying from ride to ride during our 11am 8pm visit.If you are anywhere within walking distance of an MTR stop, definitely consider taking the train to from Disneyland. From Central or Kowloon, you simply take the orange line to Sunny Bay then transfer to the Disney dedicated shuttle train.Disney's policy prohibits  food and alcohol  and contains considerable restrictions on size of backpacks and strollers. We saw no attempt by Disney security to enforce these restrictions. They did indeed search bags but only the main compartments of backpacks and purses and it appeared solely to confirm there were no large scale weapons. If I had to do over again, I would not hesitate to pack plenty of food and snacks (not surprisingly food at Disney is expensive!) and to bring our child's full size stroller so that he was not as tired fussy towards end of day evening. Disney also has a bag drop office located outside of security so in the unlikely event you encounter an overzealous security guard you can always leave your giant stroller or cooler full of food there. Tips Suggestions  Don't hesitate to bring your own food drinks  Stroller bag size restrictions don't appear to be enforced  If you arrive at opening, start with the rides furthest away from entrance (you'll likely face no line), then work your way back towards the entrance  Both the afternoon evening mainstreet parades are worth seeing, the evening parade includes lots of lots of neon lighting.",Disneyland_HongKong

It   s a small park (in comparison to Orlando) but still there were all the great parades, street performances, rides and shows you find at Disney. Prices were a bit    Hong Kong    like but that was expected. There was however problem with the WiFi. That did not help if you wanted to use the app (which usually had wrong queue times).

The downside of this visit was the employee, they didn   t even smile to us, not really helping. And the weather was very hot but the good thing was the waiting area to the games full with fans.

I loved the special effects. Strongly recommend a visit. Jan Lindrum",Disneyland_HongKong
552111145,5,2017-12,Japan,"We went there 29 30 December 2017, staying in one of the Disney hotel helped a lot because we just took shuttle bus and visit the parks in the morning and comeback and rest in the afternoon before head back for firework and night attraction. Our favorite attractions are Big Grizzly Mountain and Parachute drop, highly recommended. Parades were great as usual, especially Xmas theme related shows. Firework was also second to none. The only point that I kinda dislike was F&B in terms of price, long line to purchase, and taste was just decent. However, you can bring your own food and drink inside as long as you carry them with your backpack.Tips:1. Go there early, and go inside to Toy story zone first so that you can enjoy attractions then walk back up front for other attractions and parades.2. Like other Disneyland, foods and drinks are allowed as long as you can carry in your backpack (luggage with wheels is not allowed) Thus, bring food and drink so that you save some money.3. Use fast pass, when possible and also you should download Disneyland Hong Kong app (very useful because it tells you how long you have to wait for each attraction) 4. Buy Ticket online before go to park so that you can skip ticket line (line was long during our visit)Hope you will have great time here ^ ^",Disneyland_HongKong

551858612,4,2017-12,Australia,"Being a 90s kid, watching the likes of the Lion King, Toy Story, and Tarzan, visiting Disneyland brought me back to the 90s.So much variety, from rides, to food, to merchandise and photos with mini and mickey mouse, Disneyland Hong Kong has something for all ages (But mostly for children). Mad sure to book online prior to arrival, you may enter the park with online QR code tickets (this helped as I didn't have to line up to get tickets. Arrived around 12:30pm, on the Disneyland train which was exciting. Line up to get into the park was short, once I was in, the park was packed. With park entry you are entitled to receive three fast track entries to any ride, you must go to the ride and scan your ticket in the fast track lanes and come back when the ticket advises you too.Made sure I grabbed an English language map then took the train within the park to check out the entirety of the venue which gave me an idea of what was in the park. Visited the Iron man and star wars ride within tomorrow land, the jungle river cruise, the  its a small world after all  ride, and Tarzan's tree house. Took a photo with Minnie and Mickey Mouse (Had to line up for over an hour).Make sure you stay until 9:00 pm for the fireworks at the parks close. Merchandise is expensive just like any other theme park and or zoo. Food is also expensive, but there is variety depending on the area you are in. Tomorrow land had burger and chip meals, near the jungle river cruise their is Asian foods. Throughout the park there is a number of pop up stands which sell ice creams, hot dogs, popcorn, drinks and snacks. I was really surprised with the waiting lines for rides, although it seems at first you may have to wait a while, the lines move quick and if the sign at the ride says a 60 minute wait realistically, for me it was a 35 minute wait which was good. Sadly didn't get to see alot, because there is so much to do, so I recommend getting a two day pass. Try get there an around 10:30am when the park opens, time flys when you are having fun.I had a great experience, Disneyland Hong Kong is a place you must go and visit.",Disneyland_HongKong
551746933,5,2017-10,Australia,"The park is separated from the rest of Hong Kong so I recommend staying on site if you can. It is also probably the cheapest Disneyland for both tickets and accommodation.But it   s not lacking in attractions. We visited during Halloween, the Villains night time parade was spectacular, the temporary haunted house was great, but probably for bigger kids.Highlights included the IronMan Experience, Hyperspace Mountain, Jedi Training, and Grizzly Gulch. Other attractions are still great, though the long line for the Winnie the Pooh is somewhat weird, I recommend using he fast pass system for that one.Food was good, thankfully, as there are no breakfast other options. We had a quick service at tomorrow land which was filling and great Value at HK$99 for a meal. And a nice meal in the Main Street Restaurant which was pricey HK$660 for two but still very nice.It is warm during the day, but most lines are in the shade or air conditioned except for the smaller rides eg Orbitron and Dumbo. And It   s a small World is always worth the effort.We got a free fast pass for staying at the hotel. Nice perk.English is not everyone   s first language, the cast do a great job communicating though.The cast members are impeccable they take their role seriously, especially in the Jedi training.",Disneyland_HongKong

Although the Disneyland in Hong Kong is smaller than the ones I visited, there were way too many tourists and it was impossible to take all the rides. As such, I missed out on some exciting rides. The queue average waiting time is about an hour or so. You can opt for FastPass at some of the attractions such as the Hyperspace Mountain and the Iron Man ride. The Disneyland also closes at 8.30pm.

We felt a day was enough as the park is quite small in comparison to anything you get in USA and therefore we walked around at least twice and covered all the rides we wanted twice too. The queues for most rides were under 30 mins without paying for a fast pass.

The rides were great, especially Hyper Space Mountain and all the Star Wars theming of Tommorwland. The food was pretty good. The lack of all the princess stuff was a nice bonus. It was easy to get to from Causeway Bay and the restaurants had plenty of space. We never had to queue more that 15 minutes for any ride (it wasn't a holiday there).

550599343,5,2017-12,Singapore,"Visiting Hong Kong with an 11 year old meant a trip to Disneyland was always on the cards.Getting to Disneyland is very easy with a dedicated Mickey Mouse inspired spur line off the MTR at Sunny Bay on the Tung Chung line (orange).As soon as you get off the train you know you are in a Disney resort. It's clean and there is a cheerful atmosphere.We spent our day taking in the faster rides now that our daughter is tall enough to ride them. The Star Wars HyperSpace Mountain ride is excellent and wait times are minimised with the freely available fastpass tickets.The RC Racer ride in Toy Story land is a basic pirate ship type of swing ride but styled like a radio control car and if anything a little faster, certainly more thrills than a normal pirate ship ride.The Big grizzly Mountain Runaway mine cars ride was closed during the day but opened later in the evening. This was a boon as we were able to ride this attraction 4 times in a row as the rest of the park had gone to the main street for the parade.Tarzan's treehouse is looking a bit tired and frankly dated... time for rethink there I would suggest. That said the adjacent Jungle River cruise was good fun.The Jedi academy in Tomorrowland was also good fun, 11yo getting to train with other Padewan Learners and ultimately go up against Darth Vader and his apprentice. All in all we had a great day. Only saw one Disney character (Alice) all day but as our 11 yo wasn't that bothered about photos and signatures neither were we!",Disneyland_HongKong

550527774,5,2017-12,Switzerland,Have been to almost all disney around the world. Been here twice its much bigger now. Clean restrooms. Much better service. My only complaint is i dont see much disney characters going around. When we were in paris we always see them almost every corner of the huge 2 park. But here u rarely see them. We where saying maybe they are short staff? My daugther was dissapointed coz we did not even see the original disney characters only mickey and minnie and donald the electric parade was awesome! Especially the cars. For me this park is more on rides only not encounter with characters. ,Disneyland_HongKong

550459937,3,2017-11,Singapore,"Visited the park with my family on Wednesday. Tickets cost HK$619. IMO the park tickets are very expensive. The park is not very huge. Hence a 1 day ticket is sufficient unless you are staying in one of the resort hotels. Not many adult rides. Majority are kids friendly rides. For more adult rides, suggest to go Ocean Park instead. It   s also cheaper. Some of rides can queue for approx 30 45 mins.Food wise, There are a variety food offerings in the park from chinese to western meals. Set meal with a main course and soft drink will set you back approximately HK$100 150.We stayed there for the fireworks. It   s the last few shows before they shutdown the fireworks for a long period of renovation. The show was spectacular. Unfortunately they don   t offer it already. At the Main Street, there were even man made snow. Nice attempt to bring the Christmas mood.",Disneyland_HongKong

Get there early and avoid the fast pass rides(there is only 3 and u can fast pass them later to get a short que) go for the big ticket rides in the toy story land and the grizzly land as those lines get upwards of 50mins throughout the day. Watch the shows especially the lion king one  it was a fantastic show, way better then We expected it to be. Also Stay for the night light parade at 7:30   was a huge highlight.

No need to queue at tix counter. Head straight to turnstile, gain entry & exchange your meal vouchers after gaining entry.Smaller area with shorter queues compared to Tokyo. Iron man ride was an enjoyable. Son also enjoyed the Jedi training which you have to register at the gift shop next hyperspace mountain. Make good use of the fastpass where possible (mainly for hyperspace, iron man & winnie the pooh rides). Toy story land was nice. The castle is relatively small & not accessible. The 2 parades were good (shorter than Tokyo), highlight was Lightning McQueen and Mac truck.Lots of food option & very expensive.Capped off the night with fantastic fireworks display.

While all the excitement remains the same, the visiting hours of Mickey,minney,and Pluto have reduced which means of you are not in the queue at the right time, you will miss a photograph with them. However we manage to meet goofy twice and take a family snap which was fun. Some of the rides like flying elephant, tea cup, Winnie the Pooh had their old charm. We used the Disney railroad from main Street USA to fantasy land. We went into the fairy tale garden and took some good photograph. Then, we queued up for the festival f lion show. The show was bright and had a nice story to tell. Towards the evening we came back to main Street USA to watch parade.",Disneyland_HongKong

Only thing which i didn't liked was the cost of food items, ice creams, gift items  souvenirs etc..everything was pretty expensive.

549859786,5,2017-2,Australia,"It was my first time ever to Disneyland. I freaking love it!!! . We took MTR not far from our hotel (within walking distance). We had to change train 2x. The last train was Disneyland's train. We arrived there about 10 am ish & stayed up to about 9pm. We were buggered but it was worth it. We took some of the rides, free train ride, Gold mine ride and Star Wars ride. Had lunch and did some shopping. It wasn't cheap but I thought what the heck, I'm on holiday. It was really worth a visit to Disneyland for a 'young at heart' adults ",Disneyland_HongKong

549842579,3,2017-6,Australia,I visited Disney Land Hong Kong last year while on a 2 day trip. Overall it was okay and would be very exciting for kids or someone who had never been to a Disney Land before. I have been to others previously and found Hong Kong to be the smallest of them with only a few real adult rides. Space Mountain was by far the best of these. The evening fireworks were great as always and staff fantastic. Could do the park in half a day if required. We arrived at 11am and had seen it all by 3pm but hung around for the Parade. Lots of queues but not bad by Disney Land standards,Disneyland_HongKong
549835360,5,2017-12,Philippines,The park decoration and events are awesome during the holiday season. We enjoyed the Mickey and Friends Christmastime Ball as well as the night parade. Best to purchase via Klook to avoid the queue!  Suggestion:  Please put more restrooms.,Disneyland_HongKong

549742935,3,2017-12,Russia,"In essence, if you come after 11 am, you will only find a huge ultra loud Disney Hollywood themed upsell heaven, a huge outdoor mall with expensive toys and food, and occasional rides with 45 90 minute wait times. You will also find that some attractions with long queues are just walk through  art  displays or talking cartoon characters   a ridiculous waste of time, if you ask me. So, if it's rides you're after, the main thing is to come early, just when the doors open at 9:30. You will then enjoy all the rides within some 90 minutes and then spend the rest of your time as you please. If you can't, do buy the fast pass, you'll be helpless and very dissatisfied without it. Another worthy option is to book a stay at one of the three hotels around the park: they offer an extra admission hour from 8:30 to 9:30 in the morning plus 1 fast pass on any ride for all guests, and that helps a lot. You don't have to book direct or at HK DL site, booking.com and other aggregators may offer better deals.Prices are another pain point. Dining is quite expensive, either in the park or in hotels. You do want to consider the dining coupons offered on HK DL website, as well as ticket hotel combos and other offers; they make sense. The offers and prices there and at klook.com are the cheapest (and identical), but at Klook you can collect points and save at other HK attractions (you can save 25 HKD off your first order with code WK7A9 then explore more coupons at picodi.com). Alternatively, do bring your own snacks and drinks.If you can still feel your feet at the end of your DL experience, exit the park and walk right of the whale sculpture. You'll enjoy a beautiful and almost empty (yet also plagued with loud music) passage to the pier and hotel gardens, and a great seaside view. First hotel to your right has a great bush maze, children love it. Afterwards you can exit through the hotel and take a free shuttle bus to the train station.",Disneyland_HongKong

The rides were fun but not exhilarating.

As usual the food and drinks are ridiculously priced and in most of the park's food places it's cash only. The day we went the average wait time was about 30 minutes and the weather was perfect.

549441779,5,2017-12,Singapore,"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here. I have been fortunate enough to visit the non Asian Disney parks (including the tremendous parks in Orlando) and I was expecting the Hong Kong version to be perhaps a bit underwhelming. Not so. It had all the crowd pleasers and some rather unique experiences not found in the other parks. Both my child and the adults accompanying loved our visits.Deserving special mention would be the Mystic Manor and Runaway mine car rides. Mystic Manor was their take on the Haunted Mansions of the other Disney parks. It had minimal ghostly effects though and was all the better for it. It was an enchanting trackless ride in a choreographed group of four ride vehicles through an atmospheric and enchanting set of rooms (depending on which pair of vehicles you take you get a slightly different ride perspective; my favorite is the front pair). One of the better rides in any Disney park. The runaway mine cars rides is also a very well judged roller coaster ride with three distinct ride segments that will ensure everyone gets something they enjoy. Also enjoyed the Star Wars treatment of the Space Mountain ride.Park staff were friendly, park and toilets clean and food tasty. There are halal options for Muslim guests who should note that the turkey hot dog stand next to the bakery near the entrance is the only such stand in the park that has halal meat. Some restaurants are also halal certified.Really enjoyed my visit and would come again. For first time visitors a two day pass is recommended so that you can experience all the attractions and take your favorite ones twice.",Disneyland_HongKong

All staff are graceful and helpful, despite that they had to work extended hours and even if there are really lots of people visiting that day. Very organized and efficient during the parades.

549275479,1,2017-12,Australia,"Overall I actually love Disneyland and had a pretty great time. What ruined in for me was no one spoke to me. I've had rheumatoid arthritis since I was two and use a wheelchair and at every attraction bar one or two (shout out to guy at the carousel) every single employee asked my husband if I can walk transfer. After 27 years in a wheelchair I had gotten used to it (which is messed up in itself), but I found that once I had children people realised I could most likely respond. I had my three year old in my lap 90% of the time and my six year old nearby.

I guess I was just blown away by the excitement and the child in me so I soaked in everything with big smiles and just be happy about it. The entrance is easy, as we took the shuttle bus from the Disneyland Resort hotel. Walk for 10 mins and reached the gate. I bought tix online and redeemed easily thru the hotel guest gate. So were our meal coupons. The park is huge, and i   m glad that they have this train circling the park. It was almost Christmas and it was Sunday so the pack was there. Average 30 50 mins to wait for a ride, but we went for a Fast Pass for the Iron Man Expo, which was awesome. Had late lunch at Royal Banquet Hall and the steak did not disappoint.Do not miss the parades and the fireworks, it made our day even more spectacular and we went back to hotel extremely tired, but happy!

The lines suck, but they do so everywhere.I had mini heart attacks every time I saw the food snacks prices. I know that's how they earn but everything was just so unnecessarily expensive!

We are avid fans and have been to Tokyo Disney, Disneyland California and Disney World at least 50 times so we decided we couldn   t miss Hong Kong.This park is the smallest and most suitable for younger children but there are some unique features. There are only (4) thrill rides in the park. In our opinion the Runaway Mine Train was the best. Think Thunder Mountain but with a few twists. Hyperspace Mountain is a small scale version of Space Mountain and will appeal to fans of that ride in the US. The Iron Man Ride is a simulator and very good. Mystic Manor is a must see! It   s a hyped up and fun version of the Haunted Mansion and the technology and special effects are amazing!There are limited food options through the park compared to US parks but quality is very good.We visited on a Friday and crowds were manageable.

In tokyo, we were rushed into rides with unfriendly ushers and they were really impatient as they frowned and shouted. In Hkg, my experience was totally different. They were polite and told the visitors nicely where to exit in 3 languages, eng, mandarin and cantonese. Even in states, the service was on par.

There were only two restaurants open, but as it was easy to get a table and the food was OK.There were no queues and we were able to get on all rides and attractions with minimal queueing.

548564466,4,2017-10,Philippines,"I have to say, I love Halloween and the best time to visit Disneyland for me is during this season. The dark parade is enough reason to stay and catch the glow in the dark spectacle of villains, monsters, and the Pumpkin King himself, Jack Skellington. I have yet to go to Disneyland during another season, so am sorry if this review isn't much help :) the weather during this time is good enough to be out. Not too hot and not too cold. Plus the number of people weren't that overwhelming. Still best to go early so youhave ample time to roam around, rest and recharge, and have a go at it.It will be a bit weird for English native speakers to watch Mickey Mouse and Co. speak Mandarin during some of the Live Shows but trust me it's no issue in the long run.

It was summer so it was super hot, i learned it the hard way that u HAVE to bring used sunblock beforehand coz I got sunburned badly I went on friday and there were not many people inside the park! I rode most of the big rides (7 rides including big grizzly bear my favs, mystic manor, its a small world, hyperspace mountain, and other small attractions) The wait time is between 0 10 minutes MAX! Which is super awesome coz we dont have to que and stand in line for so long. The food tho quite disappointing, I ate at banquet hall(if im not wrong its the castle foodplace) and ordered fish and fries, my sis got hamburger and fries, and my mom ordered some noodles. The foods were bland :( The cafes pastries and bread are really good, i ordered this flaky chashiu pastry and ice milktea it was really tasty!The staffs and cast are lovely, helpful and nice, toilets are clean and big, they also have water fountain for u to drink free if u dont mind drinking from tap water.Unfortunately I did not stay for fireworks :    but for my first disney park experience I enjoyed it so much!!One tip for you all the merchandise are ofc overprice(its disney what do u expect) I recommend u to not buy the    foods    items inside the giftshops such as candies, ramen, lollypop, etc, why? Cause they are soooo overprice and you can get ur own disney themed candies foods outside disneyland!!! For example i bought this gummy candy from the park and it cost 65 HKD the. I went to best mart 360 guess what I found same exact candy for 12 HKD!!!! And guess what they have other candies with better taste and packaging with DISNEY LICENCED as well!!!

Incredibly short waiting times made experiencing the park a breeze and we were able to go on the rides more than once. The entertainment was incredible, from the parades to the firework show! Getting to the park is super easy with Hong Kings train system, the trains are super efficient, cheap, clean and safe, I stayed in Kowloon east and it took under an hour to get there, taking 2 trains both only about a 10  15 minute journey and then taking the Disneyland train which is an experience in itself.

546321081,5,2017-12,Hong Kong,"If you   ve never been to a Disneyland this is a good introduction to what Disney has to offer. If you   ve been to Disney in any other country, consider this a miniature, manageable one day version of it. The attention to details are to be admired. A lot of rides and attractions are localised, especially the Ironman Experience (which replaced the Buzz Lightyear ride). Most narration is in English, Cantonese and Putonghua, with some being in Cantonese only (Animation Academy). The Mickey Wonderous Book Show was all in Cantonese except the singing parts. However there are subtitles and it doesn   t really take away from understanding of the the graphics show. The restaurants are nothing special. The quality of food is below par and are overpriced. When we went three of the main restaurants were closed so food choice was limited. Luckily we were staying in the hotel so we had that option instead. I didn   t see any drinking water stations. We went on Saturday and Sunday. We ended up not needing the fast pass. Lines were 30 mins max. The lines which were 50mins plus we skipped until later in the evening. If you get to the park as soon as it opens, you can fit in most of the rides before noon. Late afternoon was when it got crazy busy. The evening parade was spectacular. Very impressive. The fireworks were impressive as they are much lower than most firework displays so it was extremely bright. The accompanying music was what made it extra special. And the fake snow comes on right after which was fun. ",Disneyland_HongKong
546099512,5,2017-11,Singapore,"Visited Disneyland for a couple of days and the Christmas decoration and programs were very nice. The crowd wasn't too bad and we could easily find seats during dining.

You can walk the main street up to the Christmas trees all day without a single Photographer.",Disneyland_HongKong
546098363,4,2017-12,United States,"If you like California Disneyland you   ll love Hong Kong Disneyland with its similar compact size. The park is laid out in the same pattern as its California counterpart   pass through Sleeping Beauty   s castle to enter Fantasyland, turn right for Tomorrowland, etc. Of course, there are key differences that make this park special, including hearing instructions in Cantonese before English, watching mainly Chinese cast members perform, and dining at restaurants featuring a variety of Chinese and Japanese items along with American hamburgers. It is at once a fun and cultural experience.My two favorite rides were The Iron Man Experience, a motion simulator movie ride that has Iron Man saving downtown Hong Kong Island, and Mystic Manor, a high tech reimagining of The Haunted Mansion. But no ghosts appear in this through the dark ride. Instead it retells the weird stories of explorer Lord Henry Mystic and his too curious pet monkey Albert. There are surprises funny and scary at every turn.The stage performances are top quality, including    Festival of the Lion King    with special effects, choreography, and singing on par with    The Lion King    on Broadway. My only letdown was the Iron Man Showcase when the hostess began by announcing    Our presentation will be Cantonese    and began to explain the various projects without one word of English. I was completely lost. Fortunately when Iron Man spoke, his words were only English. (Did this confuse the largely Chinese crowd?) A day   s visit here is worth the time, and you probably can do everything in one day if you come when the park opens and play all day, enjoying lunch and dinner on site.",Disneyland_HongKong

The night time parade (Light the Night) has characters from Monsters Inc, Lilo & Stitch and Cars as well as Mickey, Donald, etc. I recommend getting the Photo pass as the photographers take plenty of photos and also do the  magic shots  with characters added to your photos. There are plenty of food places for lunch and dinner. Stay for the fireworks at 8.30pm.

The rides here have a smaller height requirement and most of the rides can be done by kids.. Over the day the park sure gets crowded although we went on a weekday to beat the crowd.. I recommend that study the park before you go.. and identify the rides you want to take FOR SURE types so that you get to them ASAP and avoid long queues.For example by the end of the day the Carousel queues were really long and we skipped that.. You can consider getting fast pass too.. (we didnt).DONT MISS the Disney parade that happens at 3PM or the time they keep announcing.. And the highlight for us was the night parade.. This was the first time we were seeing it (don   t remember seeing it in Paris or US) and we were floored with it.. Its something you GOT TO WATCH to see the    Magic   .Found it better than the fireworks too..

Having visited WDW Orlando and Disneyland Anaheim our expectations were pretty high and you exceeded those expectations. The entry process was quick and easy and the staff were very friendly. Download the app before you go so you can study the map and attractions etc. this also gives you the wait times for the attractions and you can also purchase your tickets from here. The lines for the rides were minimal and the most we had to wait was 20 minutes at one stage of the day. A few of the rides and attractions we had seen before and thought it wouldn   t hurt to skip them, but having to wait less in queues meant that we could enjoy all the attractions. I   m glad we had time for this as almost every ride at HK Disneyland is different than the other parks in the USA.    Disney paint the night    was absolutely fantastic, a great addition to the nighttime entertainment. Food was a little over priced as always with any theme park but we found plenty on offer.

Overall not really friendly for kids below 7 years old as the queue is too long for those rides suitable for them and price is insanely expensive for food and rides.",Disneyland_HongKong

It will cost you less and your children will definitely enjoy this place. As compared to Disneyland parks in US and Europe, this is a smaller version in terms of scale but for your children it will be equally enjoyable and memorable. From Hong Kong Central station going to HK Disney is very easy and convenient. Just be sure you have wisely budgeted your money specifically for this trip as the cost will not be as cheap as you would think, it is going to be an experience though for your kids.",Disneyland_HongKong

We stayed for the fireworks at 8pm which were spectacular, and the fake snow really put a magic touch on the show. Highly recommend staying to see this.

There are some restos but I think it   s expensive. Maybe it   s just me. In the evening when you   ll all tired from walking and you want something hot to eat because it   s already getting cold outside, you come across this eating joint where they serve good food but the place is not well lit.

544358415,3,2017-6,Indonesia,"Visiting in the mid of June 2017, I entered the park after the weather forecast said that typhoon might hit that day. It was still 30 minutes from the park's opening time, yet it had been overcrowded, mostly by tourists from the mainland China.At 10 a.m. the gate was opened, but visitors were allowed to enter only the Main Street USA. I had to wait for another 30 minutes to get access to the whole park, only to find that all outdoor rides halted, due to the bad weather. But the weather was not totally bad, it was just intermittent light rain. Even the Mad Hatter Tea Cups, which has got roof over it, was never in operation the whole day. The halt of all outdoor rides had caused all visitors to pack into the indoor ones. Looking at almost all indoor rides having a very long line, I started to feel down. Most of the food outlets were closed. After walking around for some time, finally we came across one. We tried the food (fried rice), but the taste was just far from yummy. At 4 p.m., all visitors were told to leave the park as it was thought that the weather would get worse. The visitors that day were given a free entry to the park within one year for free. However, since I was in Hong Kong for a one week vacation, I could never come back there. I realize weather is beyond control; however, given the ticket price I paid, what I got in it (I didn't get a lot) was not worth it.",Disneyland_HongKong

544141605,4,2017-11,Singapore,"We have just returned from Hong Kong and have spent 2 days in Disneyland. November is a great time to visit, the weather is cool and it does not coincide with any China or Hong Kong holidays so the park is not crowded.Our plan was to complete as many rides on the first day and then we look at taking pictures.We had skipped all photo taking opportunities with Disney Characters and headed straight for the Ironman experience. It took us 15 20 mins to get on the rides.The ride was great, and all my kids aged 11, 9 and 5 loved it.It definitely pays to stay in one of the Disney hotels as it allows you access to priority queue to enter Disneyland.After completing the rides in Tomorrowland, we moved on to Fantasyland where we had our lunch at the Royal Banquet hall. Dining within Disneyland is pricey and not worth the value but Royal Banquet hall is one of the best places to eat.After lunch we headed to Grizzly Gulch where the Big Mountain ride was what we feel the best ride of the day. it was a 30min queue but this is peanuts compared to the queues we had at Japan Disneyland.We moved on to Mystic Point where the only attraction worth mentioning is the Mystic Manor. The ride is interesting with a tinge of scary feel to it (it was enough to spook my 9 year old..in a good way) and created a bit of excitement to weary bodies late in the day.After dinner at the Bakery (as most places had long queues for dinner) we lounged around main street to snap photos of the neon lit buildings. We made our way to the center garden and waited for the Parade to start. It was more magical lights with our favourite characters. It was awesome to see Lightning McQueen and Mack and the other Disney characters such as Toy Story Characters, Belle and beast.Fireworks came after the parade and the whole main street was filled with artificial snow since its 1 month away from Christmas. The lights on the Main Street buildings were mesmerizing.We went back on Day 2 and joined the queue to have a snap with Mickey and Minnie. They were great and duly obliged with hugs and were patient but the queue took more than an hour. I have the luxury of my Mrs in the queue while I took the boys to wander the Main Street attractions such as riding on the Taxicab. They would not have stood well in the queue. If you have only one day in Disney I suggest you skip this.We explored Adventure land after lunch and went up Tarzan's tree house and went on the Jungle River Cruise.The one show you shouldn't miss is the Festival of the Lion King in Adventure land. The performance is awesome and its not easy to keep my 5 year old engrossed in something that is not animated. We went back for 2nd rounds on some of our favourite rides such as Big Mountain, Mystic Manor and the Iron Man experience.We found some food trucks that serve packaged local fare outside Disneyland that is really affordable so that is where we ate for dinner on the 2nd day.",Disneyland_HongKong

The new addition: Mystic Manor, Star Wars ride and Iron man   s Stark Tower ride, the first is identical to that of Orlando   s, while the other two are pretty new to me. However the 4D effect is slightly worse off than those in USS, not a adrenaline pumping. The rest, more suitable for younger kids. Oh one thing, they have shifted the fireworks to 6.30pm (maybe coz its winter), and the location is at the fountain, not at the sleeping beauty   s castle. ",Disneyland_HongKong

People are also quite rude, had a couple incidents of grown adults running past us (with a 3 and 5 year old) pushing us to get to a ride. Not Disney's fault of course but doesn't lend to a pleasant experience.

The park was empty except after 4pm which made it difficult to see the evening Halloween Parade. Disney has free water & free seating all over the park for a great comfortable day. The very long Disney rides have moving seats so you can rest while enjoying the adventure. They also have great sit down shows where you also rest. At other amusement parks you stand all day for rides seconds long. There are so many wonderful adventures here at this park. It is great for parents because you are not forced to go on bone crushing rides, because they have imagination rides instead. The Lion King Show was the best, my 4 year old loved the Iron Man simulator though it was a little rough for my wife & It's Small World is a family Fun Boat Ride. The Jedi training for only very small children was a great treat for me & my wife. They hired really quality actors to play in this realistic training of a Jedi Knight. The kids believe they are doing it. The mine ride roller coaster is great without knocking your teeth out. The Mystic Manner was my favorite ride of a spooky house of a rich antique collector, though my son was hiding under the ride chair. You take 100's of photos everywhere you turn. This park is so beautiful and so clean (except the dinning area). Donald Duck 4D movie (spitting water) was good after second view, my son could not pick up the concept the first time around. Meeting Mickey Mouse on Main Street (@930am before the gates open at 10am) in all his royalty was a highlight. The early parade is better because the crowds have not arrived yet.The night time fire works show is one of the best in the world. The Chinese government had the biggest fireworks show in maybe the world the day before we went to Disneyland, so Disney kind of switched there show to a multi media fireworks lights sound themed show which made it very unique.Even with the empty park, there were no empty tables to eat food at in there dining rooms (this is something they need to fix).You will have a very long day at Disney because no one leave until after the wonderful night time fireworks show.

We spent a half day which was more than enough to ride everything and see the sites.

541483602,5,2017-10,United Kingdom,"This was our first experience of Disney. As seniors we could get in for $100 HK   a real bargain, and a chance we couldn't turn down. We got there early on a Friday as advised and when we walked into Main Street we were one of the first. We walked around the site bemused. The jungle river ride suited our age group but then we found the mire exciting rides. We zoomed up and down roller coasters, we flew up and down on dumbos, we tried most things, ogled at the characters on parade and finally sat down to an expensive cuppa with a Micky Mouse biscuit thrown in!It was great! It you have the time fellow seniors, do it!One point, they don't like you taking food in but our cheese sandwiches were allowed and our bottle of water.It gets hot, take a fan, Sun umbrella and cream up.It gets very busy later in the day so go early.The biggest queue was for Its a Small World, we hardly queued for anything else.We didn't stay for the fireworks   perhaps we've seen too many fireworks already? Perhaps we ran out of energy!",Disneyland_HongKong

It was a good day, quiet, and with no long queue. The size of the park makes it manageable, not just for young children but for older people. best to being camera, umbrella or hat to cover in outdoor exploring activities, and wearing a very comfortable walking shoes is a must. Its good also that we already purchased our ticket (entrance and meals) online to avoid the hassle and queuing lines. It was an experience for my older companions, seeing how delightful they are and how they feel young again. Disneyland never fails to unleash the child in us again.

It's not too big and overwhelming   I could do almost everything in a day without having to wait too long ( maybe because I was alone) but either way it is a comfortable park and very clean. It was super fun and the prices are absolutely ok. Would really recommend it :) ,Disneyland_HongKong

I was expecting a totally different and good experience considering how famous disneyland is all over the world. However, all I got is lots and lots of over expensive shops and food joints. After being to Universal and Ferrari world, Disneyland is a total disappointment. The much hyped fireworks are really bad. Good rides are very few and its more of a shopping complex.

I cannot imagine how the staffs handled the teeming excited crowds of people everyday.

The softcopy file will also given to you by their apps. Tips:  buy their tickets online include meal. They have a package of 4. it's cheaper buying online than buying on the spot.

Plenty to do for young kids (up to age 7 8 yrs), but for older kids or adults, you will get bored quickly. Only 3 4 good rides for this one   Hyperspace Mountain (faster and more impressive than its cousin Space Mountain), Grizzley Gulch railroad ride (again faster and more variation than Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in LA), Ironman ride (comparable to Space Tours in LA) and the Mystic Manor (  Haunted House in LA). We went for the day but were done by around 3.30pm. Good for a stop over visit if you have some time to kill on a layover from the airport (it is very nearby), but expensive ($587 HK   1 day)unless you have young kids to get value for money.",Disneyland_HongKong

Maxim   s has a restaurant here for a good grub before heading home.The Mickey Mouse waffles on Main Street was great.The meet and greet were very popular but maddening as the queues snaked out of view.Electric parade was not too impressive.Fireworks and light and sound show was lovely.Shops were nicely laid out and not too overwhelming, thankfully.",Disneyland_HongKong

We stayed until mid afternoon, there were 2 parades during that time, both were good with a lot of sing and dancing. Heaps of souvenir shops line the main walk way. We watched a 3D movie and saw a stage production. Both were quite good. They do need more seating around the area not just at the eateries. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Food and beverage was limited, long queues to take photos with the main characters, kept on changing them without any notice, limited rides, mainly for kids so Disney saying for all ages is just not correct. Hoping Paris and Florida experience will be better if i ever go. Only good thing was at the end Fireworks over sleeping beauty's castle.otherwise place is really overrated!!",Disneyland_HongKong

539863613,5,2017-10,United States,"Thanks to HK's efficient MTR system, this place is very easy to reach. Go there at least 45 minutes before opening because by opening time, there's already a huge build up of people waiting for the  flood gates  to open. And when they do, people run toward the most popular rides to try to beat each other out of the line. Our first ride was the Iron Man Experience   careful, lots of motion in this 3D theater but fun. If you can, plan for a two day visit to make the most of the park especially if you have kids in tow. My favorite experience was  The Lion King Show . Don't miss this for anything else there. Also, if you can purchase food vouchers inclusive of your tickets, do so. I did two meals and a snack   for each of my family members and I'm glad I did because we planned and did stay there from start to finish. This was a better way to save money than having to purchase individual meals there.That said, for next time, we would just buy one meal (preferably dinner that is redeemable after 4:30 PM) and a snack (a choice of popcorn or ice cream stick anytime) for each person and just eat a heavy breakfast before leaving home or hotel. My favorite meal was the  Singapore Laksa Noodle Soup  at the Tahitian Terrace (you can redeem vouchers at other restaurants as well). The Indian Tandoori Chicken meal was  blah .As for the fireworks display, try to position yourself somewhere in the Rotunda of the Main Street to have the best view of the fireworks when they conclude the day. If you have kids (or you're a kid at heart) ask the attendants for stickers, even the janitors themselves happily give them out for collecting. And, bring a water bottle. Drinking fountains are a bit scarce there (there's one by the Iron Man Experience) out that's the way to stay hydrated and saving money at the same time. If you're used to Disneyland in California and Florida, don't expect the cast to be as friendly. They are, just not U.S. Disney friendly. At least that's my personal opinion. Enjoy!",Disneyland_HongKong

I thought it was good then but very small and limited thrilling rides.Wow it has changed !!Toy story land is fantastic, All the rides were so cool!The new Iron man experience was awesome and getting to meet the REAL iron man ( so said my 5 year old) was totally cool !Mystic Manor was so different and exciting!All cast members we came across we're super friendly and all had different Disney stickers to hand out to everyone which was so nice.The Lion King show and Mickey's Wondorous book were basically 30 minute broadway shows ! It was incredible! The singing, the dancing was 6 stars !The 3pm parade and the paint the night parade at 630pm were awesome! The energy from all the performers was infectious! They looked you in the eye as they past, they waved and high fived my kids, tinker bell blew kisses to my son and made him feel so special as did the Dances in the jumping Tigger costumes. They were so talented.The park was spotless as were every toilet I went to and every eating area. Even the lady taking our order at the Comet diner was so friendly and talking to my kids and I in English. Food was good to!Every part of my 3 days here was amazing.

539614263,3,2016-12,Hong Kong,"If you are wondering whether or not to spend a day at Disney Hong Kong, it all comes down to for you are looking for.  How much do you like thrill rides?Disney HK is quite tame on that regards, with Grizzly Gulch and Space Mountain being the most ''extreme'' rides, the latter being already a slower version of the attraction.   What's the age group?Due to the above comment, a younger audience might be more appreciative.A high energy group looking for some round the clock fun would probably be disappointed by Disney HK.   Would you go mainly for the rides or for soaking up the  Disney feel ?As it's been pointed out by many reviewers, the number of attractions isn't huge and many are not rides. Some visitors come to mainly walk around and enjoy the scene. In a nutshell, if you're looking for a day packed with numerous attractions and thrill rides, HK Disney won't probably cut it and Ocean Park might be a better option.",Disneyland_HongKong

539556247,5,2017-11,Hong Kong,"Originally we were unsure about taking our toddler to Disneyland, but after reading a few blogs advice we decided to give it a go. We had a great day!  The park is a lot smaller than the original Disney in California, which I saw as an advantage. It's flat so easy with a stroller (although we only took our carrier). We caught the train, which takes you straight to the entrance. I was surprised by the number of rides we were able to take our toddler on, Fantasyland was a particularly good for this. I'll list them below:FantastylandDumbo the Flying Elephant   simple up and down ride that she loved. We had to ride separately (only 2 per carriage).It's a Small World   a little nervous about the dark initially, but loved the music and charactersCinderella's Carousel   horses are quite high up making it difficult to stand next to the toddler if you sit them on a horse. We had a carrier which made it easier, I just hopped on and she was happy to hold the pole.Mad hatter's Tea Cups   closed for maintenance :( but easy to ride with a toddlerThe Adventures of Winnie the Pooh   got a bit scary in parts (darkness thunder lightening)Fairy Tale Forest   Loved wandering around this, she happily bopped away to the music. Mickey's Philharmagic   she sat on my knee and bopped away. Did get a little loud and dark at timesTomorrowland Orbitron   very simular to Dumbo ride but in spaceshipsNothing else was suitable for toddlers ToyStory Playland Slinky Dog Zig Zag Spin   Simular to Dumbo and Orbitron but a bit fasterAdventureland We didn't make it here but the Jungle Cruise and Tarzan's Treehouse could be doable with a toddler. Theatre in the Wild   Loved the Lion King Show!!! Highly recommended!We didn't stay for the parade as our toddler was so tired. There are 2 parades   3pm and 6.30pm. Fireworks at 7.30. The food was ok, but i recommend bring snacks for the toddler (you're not supposed to bring food into the park, but as long as you're not packing a picnic they seem to overlook it).We went on a Tuesday and got there as soon as it opened (10.30am) so the park wasn't crowded and the lines for the rides were 5 10 minutes maximum. Discount park tickets and food vouchers are available through Klook and simple to redeem. We just went straight to the turnstile when we arrived.

Our longest wait was to visit with Cinderella who could not have been more gracious and kind to our kiddos. She had to be melting under her gown, wig, and makeup but she took great care to give each guest her undivided attention. All of the live shows were excellent entertainment! The Lion King was quite wonderful. We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel so we were able to break up our day, rest a bit, and return in the evening for uncrowded rides and a spectacular fireworks show.

538740219,5,2017-9,India,"We were allotted just a day for Disneyland, located on Lantau Island, in our package tour, and I knew it would not be enough from experience. ( I had been to Disneyworld in Florida and in three full consecutive days I had not been able to see all of it. ) We were awestruck by the beauty, the colourful displays and the cleanliness when we entered the Magical Fantasy Land ! We tried to work out a schedule according to the times and places where shows would be held, as detailed in the free brochure, but soon had to give it up since running from one location to another to keep up with the timings in the vast place was well nigh impossible. Trying another more practical approach, we started exploring with the help of a guide map also provided free. Still, in each attraction we could see only one or two parts before moving on, lest we miss out on many more.Being Sunday, there was a special parade from 3 to 4 and again from 7 to 8 p.m. We could enjoy a boat ride through a  jungle  with mechanised, very realistic animals, had lunch at The Explorer's Club ( there were country   region wise food areas,which sold mostly fast food and also some ethnic dishes ), saw many fairy characters and read a few pages of stories from books displayed on pedestals. We could visit or see stalls of Spider Man, Iron Man and Merman, had a tram ride and also saw The Toy Story. In the evening we enjoyed a song and dance programme in the auditorium before returning to Main Street to watch the display of fireworks at the end of the day. The entrance ticket included all rides and attractions and we did not have to pay anything more except for food and drink and souvenirs of which there was a plethora to choose from at various sales points. Some staff members gave away stickers with pictures of characters and attractions..We boarded our coach to return to the hotel, thrilled, tired, but yearning for more. SPECIAL MENTION : It had become very hot during the day. One of our group members was on a wheel chair and one of the rubber tyres became loose due to the heat. We tried to fix it back, but in vain. We were so grateful to a strong well built Philipino gentleman who helped us get back on track.At the auditorium, the differently abled person was given priority and accommodated in a vantage position along with her escort.RECOMMENDATIONS : 1. Plan for at least two full days to spend at Disneyland to be able to enjoy yourselves at leisure   more if you have young children, who would enjoy rides of which there are many. You have to queue up in many places for which some time should be allowed.2. Carry your own drinking water   it is exorbitantly priced inside !",Disneyland_HongKong

Highlights of Space Mountain, Toy Story parachutes and Mystic Manor went down a total storm with our kids as did the Lion King and 3d cinema. What nearly proved to be a disaster was accidentally locating the Elsa character greeting, completely hidden and that was what our daughter had been going to the park to find and went down less well was the one hour and 20 minute wait to get access to the Minnie and Mickey character greeting, a second set of characters elsewhere on park would resolve that for very little cost.

538214553,5,2017-3,Hong Kong,"If you've been to any of the American Disney's you will be disappointed by this one as it is a redacted version, favouring those rides areas suitable for younger children. However, it is still a lot of fun, very well maintained, and with all the characters you would expect. Well laid out and easy to get around. Easy to get to also, being a 30 minute train ride from Central. If you've never been to any of the other Disney's then definitely go here!",Disneyland_HongKong
538210359,4,2017-6,India,"It's the same verywhere. But DisneyLand has it's theme as the name suggests. The only proper, worth seeing attraction is the parade which happens around 7:oo pm in front of the castle. The rides are fit for kids from 5 10 years old. Teenagers who love the princesses can visit the garden and children lovin thrill can go to tooy story part. It's almost same as compared imagic in lonavla, but with lesser rides.

The decoration and furnishing of the whole place was amazing and fantasy like. Most rides at disneyland were very subtle and suitable for children. Overall, its a must visit and you can take alot of nice pictures there! Also, do not miss the fireworks at night near the sleeping beauty castle it was the best part so beautiful!!",Disneyland_HongKong

Did the rides, ate there and stayed for the night parade and fireworks. Well worth it. Arranged for a tour to collect us from hotel. This way didn't have to worry about trains and buses and lining up for tickets. and the best thing was that the bus was waiting at the entrance to take you straight back to hotel   especially after a long day at the park. Take a plastic poncho with you as some of the rides you will get wet. And yes   buy the Mickey Mouse t shirt too!!!!",Disneyland_HongKong
537994836,5,2017-10,United States,"My husband and I scheduled a trip to HK with no prior plans set. When he suggested going to Disney I was so excited! I have never been to Disney so this was a chance to check that off my bucket list. We preordered tickets through an app for a small discount. This allowed us to go in without queue (which seemed short anyway). It was the weekend prior to Halloween so the parade was villain themed (7pm). You'll want to get there early for a good seat. At 8pm there are fireworks over the castle, so stick around. We mostly went for the rides so I can't really comment on the characters as previous people have. We did enjoy the rides and this time of year the queues are quite short. I think 30mins was our longest queue but most were only 5 10mins. I recommend sticking around after the parade and riding a few more rides. Don't leave right then as half the park does, so transportation must be hell then. We left 40mins later and it was a breeze (ps  ride the runaway cars in the dark!) I also recommend downloading the HK Disney app. It gives you a map and the wait time of all rides in real time. Food: We did eat burgers at the park. While expensive I would say it was average price for an amusement park. Both ours were tasty. We also got popcorn for the parade and that was really good! Transportation: don't waste your money on cab fees to get here. It's quite manageable on the subway, just ask your hotel concierge and they'll direct you. Besides hopping on the Disney line to get there starts the magical experience. ",Disneyland_HongKong

537868290,3,2017-11,Australia,"I went to Disneyland to ride in the Teacups, but they were undergoing renovation   so the sign said. Many of the restaurants were closed. The Fantasy Garden where you can usually have photos taken with all the characters was also closed. The sign said Mickey and Friends would be at The Main Street entrance for photos. Later in the day when we tried to join the line at the Main Street entrance for photos with Mickey we were told that there were enough people already so we were turned away. The line was not extensive or long by an means. The Omnibus Street vehicle was out of service. When we went to Disney's Storybook Theatre to see the 4.30 Mickey Show there was an employee holding a sign saying this show is full. I think that if you are paying $100AUD you should expect that EVERY attraction would be open and operational.A tip   buy your ticket online from the Disneyland website. You will not have to line up at the ticket booth and you will save some time. If you are a visitor to Hong Kong you will also receive a $50HK shopping voucher.",Disneyland_HongKong

Some queuing but wasn't too long but would not go on a public holiday or special event day. Check their calendar online. Lots of teens there but plenty of rides and attractions geared towards younger children as well..which suited us. Worth catching the parade. Too long a queue for Mickey and Minnie to have photos but the children did get to meet a couple of Princesses. Would recommend pre booking tickets.",Disneyland_HongKong

If you are not used to the disregard chinese folks have for standing in a line, the experience will just get worse for you! Again avoid going to Disneyland on a public holiday. We were only able to ride 4 rides for a whole day because of the lines being extremely long!

Please book the tickets through klook or other similar apps. They have great options including meals at disneyland. Makes it really cost effectiveThe best option is to see the entire disneyland in one day and it is possible!!!First check out all the best rides and plan them accordingly...dont target the rides or events as soon as you enter....make a list and then tick each that you pass through....look for the fast pass options on select rides and use it wisely...with this plan you will be able to finish all the rides and attractions...wait till fireworks because it is a must and then depart with happy memories,Disneyland_HongKong

537558495,4,2017-11,Sweden,"Having visited both the Disney parks in both Orlando and Los Angeles I would judge this one as on the smaller side. Apart from that it's a Disneyland with all the magic you would expect.Extra marks for the train that immerses you into the Disney magic even before you arrive.A few things that we noted that could be better though:* On our visit several restaurants were closed. We had to search quite long for restaurants that were not waaay to expensive. In my mind, eating at a Disney park doesn't have the purpose of eating high class food, it's just about filling up energy quickly to get back into the park. If you need to close restaurants, please keep more of the lower priced ones open.* A little too much Chinese for an international park. For example, our 4 year old attended the Jedi academy and it was spoken a lot in chinese. Now, he doesn't understand English either, but if it was in English we could have helped him better. Perhaps more separate events in Chinese and English?* Opening hours 10:30 to 20:00 is too short. I don't know why they chose to open so late and close so early, but isn't most Disney parks in the US open until about midnight?",Disneyland_HongKong
537324158,5,2017-10,India,Disneyland as usual was a treat to the kids and the adults in the family too. The staff is ever helpful and friendly. The rides are great.

537304605,5,2017-10,Malaysia,"Despite a few sections of the Park that was closed for renovation, Disneyland is still a solid choice for a day's worth of magical fun! 1. I went on a weekday and almost all the rides had a waiting time of less than 5minutes. 2. Was disappointed to discover that the Buzz Lightyear ride was decommissioned. However, my absolute favorite is still Mystic Manor. 3. Food is expensive, but still reasonable. 4. There are water fountains at some designated spots, so you can fill your bottles there. 5. This was my second time visiting Disneyland HK, so 1 day is enough. Highly recommend first timer to get the 2 days pass so you can enjoy the park at a leisurely pace. 6. Currently under Halloween theme, and i didnt like the Halloween parades (both the afternoon and evening sessions) as much as the usual one.

They .spent most of their time in the rides since Disney characters were wanting to seek autographs from and pose for pictures. They were only able to get Mickey and Minnie's autographs and pictures after a sweltering 2 hour queue, Chip and Dale and a picture with Goofy who luckily was roaming the Main Street. As a Halloween treat, there were two (2) short parades added: Mickey's Halloween Time Street Party and Villains Night Out! Chapter Two. However, these couldn't compare with the pomp and glamour in the parades at LA, more so at Orlando. The place was small, the rides and the fireworks even, leave much to be desired too. At any rate, since my grandchildren did not have anything to compare their experience with, they were moderately contented, clamoring for more rides hopefully in the future.",Disneyland_HongKong
537126079,3,2017-10,Vietnam,"It was school holidays, my brother lives in Hong Kong, and I had a 9 year old that wanted to go to DisneyLand.We had a couple of days visiting my brother, and then 2 days at the Park, overnighting at the Disney Explorer's Lodge. One advantage of the Lodge is that they have a shuttle bus to and from the Park, running every 15 minutes or so. That saved time (and money) getting to and from the Park.Firstly, I was surprised at how small Disneyland was, especially compared with what I remembered of my first (and last) visit to Disneyland in Anaheim in 1985! After getting through the turnstyles, we jumped on the Disneyland train that took us around the perimeter and deposited us at the back end of Fantasyland. It was quite quiet (we arrived around 2pm) and access to the rides was not lengthy. We jumped on Dumbo, which was suitable for small kids, and then went to Mickey's Phiharmajic. That was really great, a 3D movie themed around the Mickey Mouse song, played by an animated orchestra. Featuring Donald Duck (not Trump) as the conductor. At the end of the performance Donald went flying through the air and ended up going through the back wall!We wandered across to the Mad Hatter Tea Cup and spun ourselves silly, and then had a rest and an ice cream. We caught up with some friends around 4pm, and went straight to the Iron Man show. This one was a 4D movie, and was well worth the entry fee. We were in a type of flying fighting machine, which rocked and rolled, and was based in Stark Tower, nominally in Hong Kong. A great way of seeing the skyline, being destroyed by some  bad guys . We then wandered off to Adventureland, which was the highlight, especially the Grizzly Gulch roller coaster. Can't give too much away because I don't want to spoil the fun for others, but it was great. Dusk was falling, which added to the ambience when we went on the Jungle River Cruise. Fake crocs, elephants, hippos, and natives made a lot of noise, and it was quite eery.We ended the day with dinner in the Corner Cafe, where our little girls had some spaghetti, and the men had a pair of Rueben sandwiches. Surprisingly good. Which brings me to the disappointing part of Disneyland. As said at the start, as a themed, fun park, carrying the Disney name, I would have thought it would be better. However, the main emphasis seems to be selling: average and expensive food, and poor quality Disney products. Clothes, dolls, stuffed animals, and other Disney memorabilia. It became a bit much where around every corner there was a food shop, or a retail store. In fact Main Street had one side of it filled with retail. I was fortunate that my daughter was well disciplined, and we only ended up was an umbrella, and a Mickey Spatula, to assist with her baking! Not so lucky were a lot of other parents who were weighed down with lots of  stuff .Overall, the theme park was good, and the nightly fireworks were great. However, it all paled into insignificance compared to the retail and the food.",Disneyland_HongKong
536779003,4,2017-10,Canada,"We visited on a Saturday at around 130pm and stayed till 10pm. Buy tickets ahead of time to skip the ticket line. It was busy as expected and line for rides were at least 40 minutes. Food and drinks were expensive like any theme park ($28 32 HKD for bottled drinks and $30ish HKD for corn hot dog ice cream, etc). Snacks stalls do shut down in the evening. There are restaurants that remains open. Evening is the best, as the temperature is cooler and after 6pm or so, we were able to get on all the rides we wanted to as the wait times were anywhere from 0 to 20 minutes, except the night time stuff and kids rides in Fantasyland   lots of kids even at night! The rafts to the treehouse closes in the evening, but do go around 5 6pm to avoid standing in line. Part of Toy Story Land was also blocked off when we got there around 7pm ish. We saw fireworks at 8pm and parade at around 9pm. I've only been to Disney World in Florida. So, in comparison, this Disneyland is much more manageable as a day half day trip.

536763852,3,2017-8,India,"Ever since we visited the park in Los Angeles, my daughter was keen to visit the one again and we decided to take her to Hong Kong. We were extremely enthusiastic about this place and bought 2 days ticket but we couldnt even spend one full day here. This place is nowhere close to the one in US and is extremely commercial. What I mean by commercial is that the focus is more on shops rather than characters and their house, the disney experience etc. The entrance is designed similar to the one in Los Angeles. There are some rides but those are not the one that one goes to disneyland for. There is a toy train that gives a good ride across the park. However, if you are expecting to meet all the characters then you would surely be disappointed as there are only mickey and mini and they also stand in a shaded area rather than having a home of their own. Plus there arent other characters and princess castle etc. There is a food court and some eateries inside and you can also buy waterbottles etc. so dont worry about carrying food, drinks etc. In summary, what you get is all the toys  figurines etc but the place fails to offer the disney experience. Maybe Disney undermined the tourism potential of Asia and developed a very small park that focuses more on shops rather than Disney experience. After some time it felt as if we are in Disney mall rather than Disneyland. If you havent been to any disneyland then its a fine place to go to. However, if you want a real disney experience, I would suggest visiting the one the Los Angeles (if and when you plan a trip to US). You can separately view my review of the the Disneyland in US.Overall, I was indeed disappointed and its possible that this disappointment was because of my prior visit to the one in US.

536732213,4,2017-10,Australia,"Our recent trip to Hong Kong was another testing the user friendly nature of holiday destinations for people in wheelchairs. And, I am pleased to say that Disneyland Hong Kong really did step up to the mark. On entry the staff (cast members they call themselves) pay attention to those in wheelchairs to make it easier to enter. Security and bag checks on entry provide a higher sense of safety in these troubled times. And, don't forget that when you go through the gate ask for the multiple entry stamp so that if you leave during the day you can come back again on the same day without the cost of another ticket. Also if you decide to come back for a second day it is cheaper to upgrade your one day pass to a two or multi day pass at the gate than to buy another ticket. Like all theme parks Disney land is not cheap, food is of poor quality and very expensive, drinks including bottled water are also very expensive. However, they do have rides that cater for people in wheelchairs. In all our travels we have not experienced this before. The park has a number of rides that have special carriages that allow the wheelchair to be loaded passenger and all onto the ride thus ensuring the whole family can enjoy the ride together. These rides are clearly marked on the theme park maps. Other good things about the park include abundant seating as there is a lot of walking to do and a lot of waiting for the young adults (Children) who are off on the roller coasters, etc. when mum and dad are worn out. The paths are easy to navigate even with the crowds and make the use of wheelchairs both manual and electric much easier. We went during the day and then came back at night to watch the fireworks. A tip here   they turn the lights out at night for the fireworks show which in the crush of people makes this a pick pockets paradise. Keep your valuables secure and wear your bag at the front. I had my back pockets touched a number of times during the show but fortunately had my RFID wallet in my front pocket on a chain secured to my belt. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and recommend the park as a good day out for the family. If you stay at one of the Disney resorts they are only a short shuttle bus ride or 15minute walk from the park. We stayed at the Disney Explorers Lodge which already has hundreds of reviews on trip advisor so I will not repeat them here.",Disneyland_HongKong

So do plan how you want to use this facility. Bring your own water bottle to refill water.

They don't have the delicious and famous turkey legs!! In October several restaurants were closed. Something that was really shocking for Disney was people who work there did not speak English or spoke English very limited. Really a shame, In Paris, and the USA most of them are bilingual. Here you have one tip, if you are going to buy your tickets on line buy them with the 3 meal plan, you would pay 30 US dollars per person more but just one main dish for lunch is 20 US dollars, ( and you would get a snack, lunch( main dish plus soda) dinner (main dish with soda) and a discount for a beverage) so it definitely is worth it.

Been here for 5 or 6 times for the last 12 years and it is always an amazing experience. Tip: If you have young kids (7years and lower) its a good idea to get a 2day pass so you can enjoy the park at your own pacing. Not rushing every ride attraction.Do not miss the fireworks esp around Christmas time. ,Disneyland_HongKong
535786405,2,2017-10,Philippines,"I have been to 4 Disneyland Parks over the years   Disneyland Paris, Disneyland Anaheim, Tokyo Disneyland and Sea, and part of the    magical feeling    is being surrounded by their super friendly staff. HongKong Disneyland however, was entirely the opposite. I really didn   t expect majority of their staff to be grumpy, snobbish, super rude even. Majority don   t smile, they don   t greet, they are not willing to help you out even when asking for a simple direction, they shout, my 4 year old son even got scolded in front of me since he was holding on to one of the queue ropes, the worst part?  I was carrying my son because he got tired while waiting for the queue at the ironman ride, this young staff shouted at me and asked me to put him down! I wanted to argue but I don   t want to ruin our mood so we just complied. In the royal banquet restaurant, the staff are also hot tempered. We hardly understand their english, so we politely requested to repeat what they are saying, but as expected, the staff got pissed and shouted again.When asking for direction, they seemed to be not in the mood to assist as well.In the merchandise stores, don   t expect them to help you when you are buying a US$60 toy and (after paying) you want to try if the battery operated toy is working. I have been told that    it should work or just bring it back it if doesn   t   . The positive side: The park is clean, and there   s always an english translation in almost all the rides. Also, since we went there on a weekday (Monday & Tuesday, which I think is the best time to visit), there was hardly a queue on majority of the rides and attraction . The longest queue is around 20 minutes, while majority is 5 10 minutes thereabouts.I am not sure if our experience with their staff is culture related, but majority of the staff at Disney Hollywood Hotel, including the shuttle bus drivers were likewise rude. I will be sharing our experience at this hotel in a separate review.All in all, if you are used to the friendly ambiance in most Disneyland Resorts, you basically have to lower down your expectations when visiting Hongkong Disneyland. Disney Management should seriously look into this. I am not sure if the staff are compensated well, but they should be consistently reminded to be customer service oriented, because they definitely seem to be the most unhappiest, and unfriendliest staff.",Disneyland_HongKong
535719859,5,2017-8,India,"Amazing experience that we all had fantasies about. when you are  in  Disneyland, your are a child again and  that  is  the  best  way to  enjoy your  day..",Disneyland_HongKong
535385151,3,2017-10,United States,"I wish I could give 3 1 2 stars because that would be more accurate. However, this is a hard review because there are some positives, but there are some big negatives to Hong Kong Disney.POSITIVESWait Times   If you go during the week and get there when the park opens (generally at 10:30 AM), you will have 10 minute waits or less for the first couple of hours in the park. We went on a Monday in October and waited 5 10 minutes for all the major rides until around 1:30 2:00 when the park started to get more crowded. Even then, our longest wait was 30 minutes which would be considered short wait times by Orlando standards.Unique Rides   Big Grizzley Mountain is a superb ride that combines the best of Expedition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain. There are two great surprises on this ride that make it stand out as one of the best coasters Disney has assembled. HyperSpace Mountain combines a Star Wars theme to its classic ride to make it more exciting the original. And the new Iron Man ride is outstanding as well. Lastly, Mystic Manor takes the trackless innovation of Tokyo Disney's Winnie the Pooh and creates a Haunted Mansion experience that's truly one of the best.Shows   There are some terrific shows at the park, namely: Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. Great music, costuming and special effects.NEGATIVESSize   Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely small which means you can pretty much do all the attractions in a single day. We choose to ride our favorite rides 2 3 times and we still rode 80% of the rides at the park.Cast Members   I can't even believe I'm saying this about a Disney property, but the Cast Members were lacking...by a lot! Rarely did we receive a smile. No Disney cheerfulness. No excitement whatsoever in any cast member we saw. It makes you realize how much of the Disney experience is wrapped up in the attitude of their cast members because it soured our taste of this park.Line Cutting   People must have cut in line on us a dozen times or more. It seemed accepted and even the cast members looked the other way (figuratively   because most were looking right at them and didn't do a thing). Again, this really took away from the experience. Nothing about the atmosphere at HK Disney seemed  Disney esque There are other minor items on both sides, but these are the major points of interest. Having been to 9 Disney parks around the world, this would definitely be at the bottom of the list.That being said, if you want to go and ride some terrific rides at a park that is not terribly crowded most of the time, then I would encourage you to go. Quite honestly, the little kids probably won't even notice. But the adults, they will notice that this park does not have the Disney mystique.",Disneyland_HongKong

I was also very impressed with the cleanliness of the park and amenities there was not a spot of rubbish. I would definitely visit again. Price and availability of souvenirs also excellent.,Disneyland_HongKong
534787715,3,2017-5,Australia,"We love Disney parks but this one lacks so much appeal compared to USA parks. There is no atmosphere in the park, in parts it was like a deserted ghost town. It is smaller compared to the others which is not a problem but its just lacking in so many ways. The staff are not as friendly either.Some good rides there like your usual space mountain, buzz lightyear etc. Food and drinks are really expensive so be prepared. As a family we never had to really que for anything which was great. Sadly we did not see the parade as a huge storm came over the park. This did not detract from our day as we have seen parades before. Can't quite put my finger on it but we all agreed the park was missing the Disney sparkle.",Disneyland_HongKong

The choice of food at restaurants is average but do try the mickey waffle with cream in his ears!!The worst bit for us was character meeting where the staff believe they are entitled to talk and behave with customers the way they like. We had first hand account of a couple begging to meet a character but they were turned down even though they'd come from abroad since they were five minutes late. We ourselves wanted to take our children to meet Donald but were slightly late since my wife stopped to help an elderly couple. I totally understand that being late is not an excuse and am not even arguing about it but the way the lady behaved and talked to us is at best appalling. We don't speak Chinese and she then started joking about us with other customers and they were all laughing. My family was very upset at this so I went to the guest relations team to lodge a formal complaint. The guy there took details of the incident on a small piece of paper and did not ask for my name contact. When I asked how they would send me feedback he said they don't but that he would raise it with the department of the employee concerned.",Disneyland_HongKong

532829037,4,2017-10,Sweden,Being middle aged without any kids I probably am the wrong person to rate this since it is a fantasy land for kids. But there are still quite a few things for us adults as well. I liked the Star Wars themed Hyperspace Mountain is a really fast and cramped rollercoaster. Since it all is so fast I didn   t really get the Star Wars feeling I wanted. I really liked the Iron Man Experience. And the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars was a great rollercoaster. But what I really loved was the Mystic Manor. A great little thing that really draws you into the story. We went on the Monday after the Golden Week and didn   t need to use any of our Fast Passes. Great! We didn   t have a problem doing everything we wanted in a day.,Disneyland_HongKong

At this stage of life, I forego the more adventurous rides and was more than satisfied with the    It   s a small world    wonderful    river cave    type boat ride gliding past animated representations of children from all over the world (did that twice), the Cinderella Carousel and the quite amazing Mystic Manor attraction.

The lines to the rides were 10 minutes or less and the crowds were not overwhelming. Drawbacks, although it was Disney, I felt like it was Disney at 50% effort. It was Halloween and I have been to many other parks at this time and the decorations are amazing. Hong Kong Disney had Halloween decor up, but it seemed to be the leftovers from the other parks. It was not the same feeling you get in LA, or Orlando. I am glad we went, but definitely ok with going one time in my life. Side note, the weather was miserable.

532179238,5,2017-6,Hong Kong,"From the start it is an adventure! From the sunny bay MTR train station there is the Disney train that goes straight to the park. You could take a taxi but the train completes the Disney experience here. You should take the train. One comes every 3 mins.While quite a bit smaller than Disney in Orlando, FL, this Disney packs a lot of great things in. It has tons of great rides for the small ones and everyone else, including tea cups and dumbo. There is also Space Mountain but it is Star Wars themed and SUPER cool!!! Our favourite ride by far!!! It's like being in the scenes of the death Star battle with Tie fighters and x wings zooming in every direction. Our 7yo son thought it was a bit loud and fast but this was the first rollercoaster he has ever been on.We all really enjoyed the jungle boat ride  our guide was very funny! Tarzana tree house was also a favourite.Get your pictures with Micky, Minie, Cinderella, and all the Star Wars characters too !!!!We went on a Wednesday at 11 and it was great bc it was not crowded and we waited only 5 mins to get on rides!!!! That's almost unheard of!!!!The castle is small but still cool to see. We didn't stay for the parade. It would have made for too long a day.

My suggestions specially during summer:  bring umbrella and your camera phone  bring a lot of water (expensive inside)  wear rubber shoes and comfortable clothings  bring face towel tissues wet & dry  try all the rides as much as you can  be a child again enjoy the ridesAnyway, my mom's 73 but still strong and healthy... she enjoyed that moment ",Disneyland_HongKong

Autopia (also known as Tomorrowland Speedway) has been shut completely and I remember there was a roller coaster ride which is also gone. However, they've replaced it with Buzz Lightyear Space Mission, which is fun   its a 1v1 laser shooting game where to hit targets to gain points. I remember I was so good at it I scored over a million points (max level) HAHA.Space Mountain ride is a must go!!! It's the same as the one in Disney World!!! Loads of fast corners and humps!!!The rest is pretty much the same so nothing much to talk about.The only thing good is with the opening of Shanghai Disneyland, you will hardly see any Mainland Chinese tourists in Hk Disneyland.

Once again we had a wonderful holiday, with the hotel exceeding itself.Stayed Concierge level, which was well worth the extra cost. We received fast passes for every day plus daily priority entry to the first Storybook show (which was wonderful, albeit slightly weird with Goofy, Mickey and Olaf talking in Chinese, with songs being sung in English).Breakfast was plentiful, as was the evening food. The free wine and beer each evening was very welcome and relaxing after a day exploring or visiting the park. Having Mickey, Minnie or Daisy duck visit the lounge in their pyjamas each evening was quant and something I wish Disneyworld did. Both children and adults got into the swing of things and turned up in their PJs!Was able to explore the 2 other hotels, and if we wanted to could use their facilities. The only negative was a lack of a restaurant bar at the pool. Having to order room service which took an hour was not ideal. There was a jug of water by the pool   s entrance, but sometimes water will not do, so we ended up getting dried and dressed a few times and going to the lounge just to have a cup of tea. For some reason none of the 3 hotels appeared to have food facilities at the pool     something I have not encountered before.Tip     by the annual pass for the park     we did and got a good reduction in room prices, discount at park restaurants and on shopping     well worth the money and the tickets are dirt cheap compared the Disneyworld!Can   t wait to visit again, hopefully in a year or two.",Disneyland_HongKong

We arrived on the train at about 10am for a 10:30am opening and we breezed straight through the bag checks and joined the lines to get in. They opened Main Street early for some shopping which was perfect as we had the chance to scope out some purchases for later in the day. Most of the park opened at 10:30 and we headed straight to Adventureland to ride Jungle Cruise. They have the option for several different languages which is great for visitors that don't speak English. We then waited a few minutes for Grizzly Gulch to open and headed for a few rides on that and then Mystic Manor. They had an interactive marvel attraction thing happening which was good. Without giving a full run down of the day we pretty much managed everything we wanted to go on and saw all the parades, fireworks and special Halloween happenings. The magic book show was brill. I think it's a bit disappointing that they cancel Paint the Night for Halloween as the Halloween parade was average in comparison. Tomorrowland is a little sad at the minute with all of the renovations but we loved the Iron Man experience, a nice evolution of star tours.

There was a separate line for in house guests and day visitors at the entrance. One day is enough if you plan to just roam around the park. But those who would like to ride all the rides and witness all the live shows cannot do it all in one day since the waiting time range from 20 60 minutes and there are a lot of great attractions inside the park. I highly suggest you wear your most comfortable footwear because you will be on your feet for hours.The live shows gave me chills because it brought back a lot of childhood memories. My salute and respect to all the talents!The food was a little bit pricey but its serving is big enough for a parent to share with a child. Our favorite restaurant was Explorer's Club. Water is quite expensive there so better bring a water bottle you can refill from water fountains near comfort rooms. Speaking of comfort rooms, every attraction has a CR with many cubicles and tissue papers. There are also defibrillators located near every comfort rooms. When visiting with children, the park has strollers for rent. And they have a station for lost children where you can report a missing child (heaven forbids!).

We bought our tickets on klook so slightly cheaper. The people were so rude, not staff but other customers, pushing, shoving, prodding. Theres no such queuing system, it doesnt matter that you have been waiting an hour, someone will come along, pretend someone else is ahead, get to a certain point and call the rest of the family friends to push in!! Because of the language barrier i got a lot of giggles, shaking of heads and just ignored when confronted them. It happened in pretty much every queue which ruined the whole experience. Also the park is small, theres no cooling system , perhaps more sheltered areas, AC, Fanned areas, even in the queue they could have them water spritzing things, the excessive heat made it uncomfortable. Theres not enough food options, not enough international, we ate at the corner cafe but had to wait 30 mins to be seated.

They had all the great rides that all the Disney parks have, other than pirates of the Caribbean and splash mountain. It was a bit disappointing not having a water ride in HK, considering how hot it is. Two things that disappointed us was that we really struggled to find vegetarian meals that were dairy free (allergies) and the merchandise wasn   t great. We didn   t buy any merchandise.

The rides are wonderful and the shows were amazing. We especially loved festival of the lion king. There are potable water stations near the washrooms where you can refill bottles. This is such a wonderful feature! Disappointments: I was disappointed that character greetings were marked on the brochure but when we went, there weren't any characters there. Some rides have no shaded area to stand in. Advice: bring an umbrella to make your own shade..... this will make or break your day. I hope you go and have a fun day!! ",Disneyland_HongKong
530441776,3,2017-9,Hong Kong,Bit of a disappointment really as is tiny ..gives an idea of Disneyland ..but only as far as people movement etc. Good for rides ..queues of course but wait time is not long.,Disneyland_HongKong
530415337,5,2017-10,Australia,We bought our tickets at the gate and we're concerned at the length of the queues but everything moved quickly and smoothly.Staff are helpful and friendly. we went on the Hyperspace mountain ride first off only 15 mins wait   in air conditioning. Then Iron Man experience about 20 min wait. It stormed and rain heavily during the day but the park kept the as many rides open as they could. We ate lunch by the Iron Man experience. It was good quality tasty fresh food. It was served quickly and we really enjoyable. We queue for a food rides but the lines move quickly and loads are air conditioned waiting areas. We stayed on to see the Halloween parade   it was all in Chinese but the costumes and performers were excellent. The train ride back to Sunny Bay and the whole experience was enjoyable. ,Disneyland_HongKong
530100654,4,2017-10,Australia,"Disneyland never fails to disappoint. HK Disney is really easy to get to by train and once you get off you feel like the magic begins. Go in the middle of the week if possible because it isn't as busy, the longest we waited for a ride was 30 minutes, and even though you wait it's still an experience. The best rides for adults and kids over 7 were Hyperspace Mountain and Big Grizzly runaway minecars. When it comes to food I highly recommend taking snacks and water. With the water though you can fill them up at the water stations. We had dinner st the Corner Cafe which was ok given the standard of food at all Disney locations. 10 hours later, sore feet and tired kids but it's all worth it   it is the happiest place on earth! ",Disneyland_HongKong
530082824,5,2017-9,Philippines,Talk about being a kid again... Disneyland will still and always be the happiest place on Earth. Hyperspace Mountain is my favorite ride. I cried during the Flights of Fantasy Parade seeing my childhood virtual playmates come to life. The festival of yhe Lion King was definitely a hit! And of course the fireworks is a much watch. We booked through Klook for discounted tickets and it was definitely a great choice. ,Disneyland_HongKong
530048726,4,2017-10,Australia,"This was our first family experience of Disneyland, and whilst good was probably not comparable with the US parks. I'm saying this as it was easily covered in a day. For the younger kids it's great, but post 6 or 7 the rides are limited. That said, we still had a great day and the ambience is magical. My son is 8 going on 9 and loved the day. The rides are clean and the place is well staffed. The park was packed when we attended as it was the day after a public holiday, and the heat was oppressive. But we still had a great but very tiring day. Having been to Ocean Park, for older kids and whilst it's not as polished as Disney, it has bigger rides that will better suit them. ",Disneyland_HongKong
529767030,4,2016-12,Singapore,Perhaps because we went really early in the day but this trip to HK Disney land was really quite enjoyable.

No complaints! The Christmas decorations made it even more special!,Disneyland_HongKong
529757730,5,2017-9,Philippines,"Great to see Micky Mouse, and several Disney Characters.  Had a chance to see Cinderella.

Jungle boat ride, grizzle roller coaster ride,lion king show for kids etc were good. Try fast pass during peak hrs to skip queue. Visited end of September on a weekday. Very less crowd and didn't have to wait more than 5mins for any rides or shows. Took popular rides even 2 3 times. Not the case during usual days where queues take 30 45mins for popular rides. May be this time of year is best to visit. ",Disneyland_HongKong

529459754,2,2017-10,India,"The crowd in Hong Kong in general is rude and impolite and will not think twice before pushing and shoving their way through. And this trait of those visiting Disneyland gets heightened even more. The rides have a minimum waiting time of 1 hour. Often it seems people don't even know why they were standing in a particular line. Just not worth the experience. If you just can't miss this, then at least go after 3 pm. Most rides are open till 8 and park is open till 10:30. Disappointing and just not worth it. ",Disneyland_HongKong
529356026,5,2017-9,India,Kids will love this place with all the rides and characters (as with any disney property).

We enjoyed the free show called Lion King festival that showcased story of Lion King cast of many talented people and impressive stage not to miss the lady in the trapeze, fire dancer and huge puppets. Must see when visiting this park. Only downside is most food stall and restaurants opens from 12 noon so best to bring food and drinks for your kids to make sure there will be fuel for the before you can buy anything.",Disneyland_HongKong

Something for everyone!,Disneyland_HongKong

528975284,5,2017-9,Singapore,One of the main objective of my HK trip is to head there with my GF. Huge locations with various Disney theme places. Lots to buy definitely but the stations are either for kids or a huge disappointment after a long queue. 1 hour was wasted due to the rain but we persevere. Restrooms are not the easiest to locate,Disneyland_HongKong
528971701,5,2017-9,Australia,This is a fabulous destination that offers something for all ages and fitness levels. The older kids loved the big thrill rides. The time of the year we visited was very hot but the up side was there were very few queues for the rides allowing the kids to ride each ride a few times before moving to the next ride. Loved the atmosphere and the high standards of presentation throughout the park. Highly recommended.,Disneyland_HongKong
528870835,5,2017-9,India,Decided to use the short school break to bring my child here. Stayed at Disneyland hotel which too was a great experience. Beats five star hotels in price and comfort. The park was a great balance of good rides and accessible distances.,Disneyland_HongKong

Its a place where anyone will definitely enjoy! Disneyland is the place where everyone can believe that everything is possible. Its the happiest place ineed.However I enjoyed the experience very much on my first visit because the parade on a regular day is full of amazing lights in the evening. But I think when there is an occasion like halloween the parade of all the Disney characters happened in the afternoon and at the night parade is for the villains.

However it still has the quintessential happy Disney vibe about it. Worth a visit as it still puts a smile on your face. Make sure you don't miss the Lion King show. It is brilliantly done with props and big strong voices. If arriving by train, you will love Disney's own carriages, it is a fun way to arrive and kick start your day ",Disneyland_HongKong
528484653,3,2017-9,United States,"Maybe September is not a big month for Disney Hong Kong or maybe it was the weather, but several rides were not open. Our biggest disappointment was that Buzz Lightyear had closed the previous weekend forever. It will be rebranded as part of a new theme being developed in that area. The line at Buzz was always not too long (like Orlando) so we would ride it over and over again. I guess we're stuck with trying to get fast passes in Orlando in the future.The Lion King was very good with some changes improvements from the last time we visited. The only bad part is the wait to get in.Hong Kong Disney size wise is nothing like Orlando so if that is what you are expecting you will be disappointed greatly. It is worth at least one visit (we've been 3 times) just to do something other than go downtown with the crowds. We've never experienced the lines of Orlando so the wait time is much shorter and you can cover all the rides easily in a day. It's just not as  magic  as Orlando and everything is smaller   even the castle. It's a small world ride is as good as Orlando though.",Disneyland_HongKong

527224973,5,2017-2,Philippines,"Located in Lantau Island, Hongkong Disneyland has always been dubbed as one of the most magical places on earth! Yes, it is truly magical as you will be seeing a lot of Disney characters you might have watched (and sometimes, your favorites)   from Princesses, to figure character and more! You will be able to meet your favorite Disney characters, watch live shows and parades, and shop and dine at all themed areas of the Hong Kong Disneyland park! HK Disneyland is accesible both via train, car and buses! Making it always on top of the lists whenever tourist planned going to Hongkong. HK Disneyland yet being so magical, is so HUGE that even (i think) a day pass would not be sufficient enough to pay a visit and enjoy everything it has to offer. They got a lot of attractions, interactive, inviting and most of all exciting.TIPS:1. Book your ticket in advance. Though getting ticket on the day itself would be fine, just to ensure you are able to manage potential hassle, I would highly suggest to book your tickets ahead. They got 1 Day Disney E Ticket ranging from $70.00 to $75.00 and 2 Day Disney E Ticket ranging from $90.00 to $97.00. These are e tickets that can be purchased online. Once redeemed your voucher for your physical ticket, you must enter Disneyland within 3 days. For 2 day tickets, your first entry must be within 3 days, the second within 7 days of the first visit. Child tickets will be sold to children within the age of 3 11.2. Check the weather. There are chances HK is in rainy season, so you might want to prepare your Rain Gears! If the weather is sunny, make sure you have sunscreen protection, sunglassed or umbrella. 3. Water is a must! You need to get a hand on a bottle water as surely you will be having loads of walk!4. HK Disneyland is so big and it is advisable to always refer to the maps provided on the entrance. As Disneyland also provides wi fi, might as well download their app (IOS and Android) for better schedules of attractions. better attraction timings such as meeting disney characters and show times. 5. Between 2:30pm to 3:00pm (Local Time) they are hosting parade of colors which will give you a glimpse of the different disney colors.6. Between 6:00 to 6:30pm (Local Time) you will be able to witness Parade of Lights! I absolutely love this one   very stunning and spectacular.7. I suggest you stay for the entire day as by 7:30pm, you will be able to watch with awe the spectacular fireworks display to cap the day!Enjoy!!!",Disneyland_HongKong

I'm not saying that this park isn't fun, it's just a little bit fractured compared to other Disney parks. The lands while they exist aren't as harmonious as you might find at other parks. The difference at this park is the quality of some of their attractions. Mystic Manor is probably one of the best Disney rides ever built. Grizzly Gulch Mine Train is one of the best roller coasters on any Disney property. Best of all each one of these attractions is surrounded by a well themed land.The new Iron Man attractions are OK, but nothing worth the trip alone. The food at this park is hit or miss, depending on where you eat. This could be a one day visit, or a two day visit if you're really into Disney parks.",Disneyland_HongKong

On a whim my adult son and I decided to spend a day at Hong Kong Disneyland and we were not disappointed. Because we went last week when most children were in school, we did not have to wait in line for any rides which was great. There are not a ton of rides at this park but what they did have we enjoyed and we were able to do the whole park in one day without rushing around. My particular favorite rides were the Star Wars themed hyper Space Mountain and the Mystic Manor ride.I understand that this is the smallest of the Disney parks and as adult I found it relaxing and fun. I am not 100% sure that older children would be as captivated but this park is really a great size for families with smaller children. With Disney having Marvel & Star Wars rides now  I think that teenagers will be into the Disney parks too and if Disneyland Hong Kong adds more of these type rides they will get the teenagers excited about Disneyland Hong Kong too.Food was decent, the walk in ticket price was good considering I spent the whole day exploring and riding rides. The firework show was quite lovely too. Also I managed to go on the first day of the Halloween themed parades and the Hong Kong Disney Haunted House  Maze of Madness: The Nightmare Experiment Continues.

Worth going about half hour before opening time at least once to see opening ceremony and get some pictures with characters on Main Street. We were lucky enough to be visiting during the Tsum Tsum Fun Fair 2017. You pay extra to participate in games where you get and can win exclusive Tsum Tsum. Staff get very excited when people win. It was fun just to have a go. During the 2 days we never waited more than 5 10 minutes for a ride and on most occasions walked straight onto the rides. Fast passes not needed at this time of year. Mystic Manor is a must do. The Lion King Show and Mickey and the magical book were also good. Pin trading is available around the park but didn't observe many people doing so. Halloween activities were also on while we were there. All free. The maze was fun but scary for little people but not in English. Halloween Villain parade was great fun. Watch out for coupons when making purchases in the park. Would happily visit this park again.,Disneyland_HongKong

Not sure if this is the norm, but it was nice. The park as a whole was very clean (as to be expected) and even in the stifling heat humidity the cast members and parade performers put on an impressive and enthusiastic show.I'm an avid fan of the Haunted Mansion. When I read about Mystic Manor, I was a little disappointed that it would not be the classic experience that I have grown to love. However, MM really blew us away. It was lighthearted and adorable. Albert is so cute. We ended up doing this attraction twice. Space Mountain seemed slower and less impressive than the other parks, but it was still fun. We walked right onto the ride, so that helped.I love Star Wars and was skeptical of the Iron Man Experience existing in place of Star Tours. Again, we walked right onto the ride, but the items they have on display in the queue seem like they would be interesting to examine and would help to pass the time if there were to be a line. The ride was fun and it excited into a ship full of Avengers merch. The Halloween decorations were cute of course. I was very impressed with Toy Story Land. All in all, I'm very glad we used our extended layover to visit HK Disneyland and Resort. It's worth it if you're a Disney fan. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Download their app for better attraction timings such as meeting disney characters and show times. 1 day pass is not enough to cover the entire park! Too many lands to explore! Standy sunscreen, cap, sunglasses, umbrella! Loads of walk too. Recommend you guys to stay till closing when they do their fireworks display at 8pm HK Time. Same day re entry into park allowed. Just keep your tickets and get your hand stamped! The only bad thing is the overpriced water stations! They should have water coolers around too! Standby loads of cash for water and merchandise!! If you missed out on some merchandise, Hong Kong Airport Terminal 1 has a mini Disney Store! ",Disneyland_HongKong

It was a nice place for kids and kids at heart. We might go back and bring along our children so we can enjoy the moment with them .

You can also skip the long ticketing queue. Disney experience will require a full day. As i have made my visit twice to HK Disney on different occasions, my advice is try to come during the cool winter season. Under 34deg weather, you will easily go  punctured  by afternoon. Do arrive at the time of opening if you want to maximise your coverage of rides and shows. Some form of strategy is required. Bring your water bottle and keep yourself hydrated.

It's a great one day trip. Train stop begins and departs a short walking distance from the entrance. It wasn't overly crowded and we never had to wait long for any of the rides. Food was excellent for a theme park! Parade was fun, but too long to stand in the hot sun and heat. Hong Kong is very hot and humid. Our tour guide on the Jungle River Cruise was hilarious and made the ride fun. Our favorite ride was the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars.

Even the Grizzly rollercoaster isn't really thrilling. Disney Hong Kong desperately needs some topattractions (Tower of Terror, Rock 'n Rollercoaster,...) The park misses the real  magic Disney feel  because of the lack of enough Disney (movie)themed rides. So no Cinderella, Snowwhite etc.Because of all this I find the ticketprice too high!On the other hand the park is really clean, the personnel are very friendly and the food is good!

Found that this time round, the place was no longer that exciting nor many things to do even though they have added in 1 new area. The toy story land was not as interesting as the one I went in Tokyo. Also the were not many rides though it was a new section. Disney service staff was also not as friendly as previously.

Some of the amazing things which we saw were in the limited time we had: All the shows are just amazing, missing the shows will be a crime if you are visiting Disneyland as Rides are good but nothing compared to Ocean Park.So, disneyland visit should be enjoyed as an experience because the shows are amazing including Lion king show, Minnie magic, Daily parade etc etc. All are just amazing.Although it is not that the rides are just not enjoyable, some rides are breadth of fresh air just like Iron Man experience, Star wars ride and many other also.If you have not visited any other Disneypark then you definitely will not be disappointed.One day is good to explore the complete place.Enjoy the trip!",Disneyland_HongKong

Judging from other reviews, September must be an ideal time to visit. We literally walked onto every ride in the park with little to no waiting. Whilst there are not a huge number of rides in this park, it was the ideal amount for us to be able to feel like we were easily able to do everything that we wanted to without any stress and still make our flight out. I would strongly advise using the MTR system to get to Disneyland. It is quick and cost effective. A big plus is the Disney train line! We made the mistake of catching a taxi to Disneyland where it cost us 10x the amount and we got caught in heavy traffic. The MTR was a lot less stressful.The 3:30 parade was a lot of fun, even for adults! Mystic Manor was my favourite ride of the day.The downside was that a number of restaurants and 2 rides were closed and I think it would have been even more fun with children!",Disneyland_HongKong

Transferred to 3rd train, pink one, and viola...Disneyland! Of course the train was almost full. But no worry, there is one every 5 minutes. We went on a saturday, and just from the train, I was sure that thousands would be enjoying the resort that day. We bought food before entering the gates, @70HKD each meal. Yummy! Just along the road getting inside. Lined up for inspection, and take note you're not allowed to bring meals, only snack is allowed inside. Starting from Moby Dick, picture taking starts. As soon as you enter the gates, you are greeted by Mickey Mouse on the lawn! No phone sticks are allowed! Start with Tomorrowland, then Adventure land, Toy Story, etc etc...One whole day is not enough. You go there with battery full, and end up with battery empty. At 7pm, the Paint the Night Parade will really awaken all energy hiding inside of you coupled with the Fireworks.

I'm not sure if it was the time of year (we went in June   and on a weekday) but the park wasn't that busy. We waited 25 mins max for probably 2 rides. The Big Grizzly Mountain mine car ride was brilliant, the queue was actually so short we were able to get off the ride and walk round to ride again and be almost straight on. We did the same with Space Mountain. We bought a ticket which included a meal at a restaurant, this was a good value and the food wasn't bad. Getting here is so simple. Take the metro to Tsing Yi and change at Sunny Bay. From here you can catch the Disney train. It took us about an hour to get there from Tin Hau, and for about   5 each way.Such a worthwhile day out if you're visiting Hong Kong",Disneyland_HongKong

Also if you have never been to California ride this version of space mountain.

Long lines for all the nice rides awaited us. Even to get a picture with the characters entailed a 30 min wait minimum. To get a lunch table, you had to dash to one when a table frees up so that you will not lose the table to another hungry group. Even then, we had fun. The weather was nice, no rains and not too cold. As we had a toddler with us, we spent a lot of time on the not so popular rides (or as my cousin would call them, wimpy rides, lol) and my daughter had so much fun. :) You can see the wonder in her eyes when she saw characters big and up close. We got fast passes for some of the rides and just waited them out sitting on some benches at the park. This is probably my third visit to this park and the first one with my daughter and husband with me. We enjoyed the shows especially the Golden Mickey show (the one with the 4D) and the Lion King. :) A not to miss attraction when you visit Hongkong, but maybe go at a non peak season so you can maximize the cost of your ticket.",Disneyland_HongKong

There is halal option which is gd, the portions really makes us full. We love the shows, its really entertaining. This is our 2nd trip to Hong kong disneyland.

520641999,4,2017-9,Australia,"Good range of rides for all ages, only 2 real adult rides but still fun. Park is relatively small so easy enough to maximise in one day and highly recommend going when it's forecast to be cloudy or rain, it's usually sporadic and generally no queues. Recommend getting a meal voucher from Klook which is easy to use and reasonable value. You can bring your own bottle of water and refill at the park. Make the most of fastpass at the hyperspace mountain.",Disneyland_HongKong

520557056,5,2017-8,Thailand,Very good place for family. But alittle hot. So umbrella needed. The food is great but pricy. Recommend to go on week day so the people are not so crowd. Easy to travel to by mte sunnybay station,Disneyland_HongKong
520392258,4,2017-8,Italy,We were 2 adults. Better to buy online the ticket to jump the queue at the box office. I think that one complete day is enough to visit the park and try almost all the attraction.,Disneyland_HongKong
520364951,4,2017-9,Philippines,Very good theme park. Ideal for the whole family. Very convenient transportation wise and very systematic. Though food inside the park is not really good and expensive. Kids will definitely enjoy the rides and the shows.,Disneyland_HongKong

519714528,5,2017-8,Egypt,We had a great day at disney hong kong . It is spacious but not crowded with rides and stages. The main street in California and the sleeping beauty castle is always busy in California but in Hong king it is only busy during the parade whichis also not as the California parade but still nice to see it . Rides has long queues but anuway worth waiting as disney rides are really great.kids enjoyed the stage live shows .the festival of lion king and mickey wonderous story book was both amazing and really the airconditined stages are teally great in the hot weather. The electric parade and fire works were nice . Shops have different stuff than California disney land .Meet and greet characters are not the same everyday and hardly you can find disney princesses.mickey and minnie are there almost all the time. It is great to visit hongkong disney park but donr put it in comparison with disneyland or WDW.,Disneyland_HongKong

All ride ques were less than 5 minutes wait! We got to enjoy all the rides indoors and some outdoors (when the typhoon force reduced to 1). The park still opens despite rain. Magical experience. Felt happy. The environment was friendly. Many staff around to guide you. Good attractions. Plenty food options around. Delicious food.

Most rides and shows were open. We enjoyed the Lion King show and lined up for photo ops with Mickey and Minnie and Donald and Daisy, ride the carousel, went inside Small World , ate at Plaza Inn and shopped for souvenirs. Too bad, the parade was cancelled due to bad weather. It would have been the highlight of our granddaughter's visit.",Disneyland_HongKong
519216571,4,2017-8,Botswana,"We managed to get great weather and enjoyed 6 great hours of Disney fun. The park has the traditional Disney atmosphere with lots of activities and stores to keep you busy. Activities for all ages from kids to teenagers   then again which adult doesn't turn into a kid when they see Mickey Mouse. You'll need stamina to walk and if it's a busy day, you'll need patience to wait in the lines. There are no traditional fast passes, look around as each popular ride has a unique fast pass method through vending machines. The food options are basic and can get very very busy at meal times. We waited for 30 mins at one location for a table and then ended up moving to another area of the park just to get a bite. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Seeing my daughter react to the characters and the shows made the entire trip worth it. Expect a lot of walking. Bring extra shirtS and water. Make use of the line passes that allow you to be in line without having to stand.If you must bring a baby stroller, pack 2 bags. One with your valuables and the other with non essentials. All rides and shows will require you to leave the cart outside, in a baby cart parking lot. Having separate bags will allow you to easily leave the other with the cart outside without having to sort out your things. All in all an awesome day. Was quite tired afterwards but we all had a ton of fun.",Disneyland_HongKong

Pricey for food and drink but so is every Disneyland, less shops and restaurants but enough for its size. Rides pretty much the same but lines not as long as USA. Transport to here via MTR and cab was very easy. Fireworks over the castle were awesome we would come back with our family ",Disneyland_HongKong
518561302,5,2017-8,United States,"We live in Florida and have been frequent visitors of Disney World there, originally with children and now with grandchildren. We were a little skeptical about the experience we would have at the smaller Disneyland Hong Kong, when we visited it last week, but we were most pleasantly surprised how they have been able to replicate the engaging  Magic  on somewhat smaller but equally entertaining scale. ",Disneyland_HongKong
518400477,5,2017-8,United Kingdom,I came here expecting it to be rammed with people and even though there were a lot the park seemed to cope pretty well with the mass volume of visitors. We caught the MTR to Sunny Bay and then caught the train   this was quite magical as a Disney themed train takes you to the theme park. Trains were very frequent so no waiting around . Queues were not too bad I think the longest was 35 mins which is acceptable in summer holidays . With the busier rides we used a fast track ticket (note there is no extra cost!!) and returned in the given time slot . After 5pm the crowds eased off and rides were easy to get on. Park is very easy to manoeuvre around   not too far to walk from one area to another. All very child friendly the staff very good and helpful   lots speaking very good English too. Top attraction for me was Hyperspace mountain   the children loved the Buzz Light year ride. Also enjoyed the Mystic mansion   great animation here. Watched the Lion King show   wow fantastic my daughter absolutely loved this . We stayed to watch the Night Parade   this was incredible ! Very pretty to see the floats all illuminated . Great Iron man ride if you don't get motion sickness   there was no queue here we went straight on . Food   you can't take your own food in and they do check your bags at the gate. Park food is expensive that is the downside   be prepared to part with money to buy the Disney brand . There are lots of outlets to eat from   food is  ok  standard . If you are feeling flush I can highly recommend a Disney themed ice cream   they were delicious but $45 a go ! So remember when its busy you can scan you entrance ticket in the fast track machine by the popular rides to get a slot time to return with no queue   there is a list of rides that have this feature on their web site. Great day out at Disney and they give you a nice fireworks display to close off your evening !,Disneyland_HongKong

The train with Mickey Mouse characters and my girl was all excited (me too)The park is stunning, invested, the film screened dazzling with smells, wonderful that make the experience extraordinary.

He loved the pool and waterslide as well as the maze. Food in Chinese restaurant good but other food was dissappointing in poolside. Club was good for breakfast but limited after that. Staff polite and well trained room ok was priced highet than 5 star top hotels....not sure it was any better than the Hollywood where we stayed last year.,Disneyland_HongKong
517379789,2,2017-8,Canada,"Was quite disappointed with the park and should have done some research. We were mostly disappointed about the small size of the park and lack of rides compared to its North American and even EuroDisney counterparts. It's quite far from HK but easy to get to by MTR although you will need to transfer a couple of time. It doesn't need more than 1 day to get through it. We bought 2 day tickets but actually did not regret it as the heat in August is oppressive and we could only stay for a few hours at a time. Favourite rides were the Grizzly Gulch train and Mystic Manor (as it was air conditioned). Hyperspace mountain was OK   Star Wars themed now but pretty tame coaster compared to the updated Space Mountains in other parks. Meet and greet with the Star Wars characters was also a highlight though. On the 2nd day, it rained a little and all the outdoor rides closed. Also all the food vendors shut down as well. Can't imagine what we would have done if we bought the food voucher. If you've been to other Disney parks, prepare to be disappointed. If this is your first time to Disney, you get a taste of what the original is like so you will likely have much more fun. ",Disneyland_HongKong

516691508,5,2017-6,Philippines,"It is smaller than Tokyo Disneyland, but getting a 2 day pass is still a must. Everything about Hongkong Disneyland was fun for our family. The staff were nice (they can speak english relatively fluently), the rides were fun, the shows and parades were great and the food was superb.The only cons about Hong Kong Disneyland is the price (but typical of any theme park).Tips:1. GET A 2 DAY PASS (so you can see all the shows and try out all the rides).2. Be there at rope drop (10:30am) in order to enjoy the entire day in HK Disneyland (the staff and photographers are happier and more energetic in the morning).3. Tell your kids to get stickers from ANY ALL staff member s early in the day (by late afternoon, they run out of stickers).4. If you will get the photopass, don't forget to ask the staff with cameras that are roaming around to take your picture (the day pass is worth it if you maximize the roaming photographers). And don't forget to have the staff at each ride (where your photos are taken. I.e. Hyperspace mountain) scan your photopass card to save your photo.5. AVOID the souvenir shops (unless you really want to buy a souvenir or two), these will take a lot of your time especially if you are with kids.6. Check out klook.com and the hk disneyland website for promo day passes and 2 in 1 or 3 in 1 meal coupons (these coupons are cheaper compared to buying food ala carte). Compare the prices on the websites before purchasing.7. Plan your day ahead. Look at the map and schedules available on the HK disneyland app or website.8. Try to watch both the afternoon parade and the night parade (around 8pm).9. ENJOY YOUR DAY!P.S. the staff strickly enforce the  no outside food policy . But they are lenient with water bottles and baby formula. Bring a water bottle or two (Bottled water is expensive inside the theme park. There are drinking fountains around the theme park and HK tap water is potable, but you can taste the chlorine.)",Disneyland_HongKong

We walked around the whole thing in a matter of a couple hours. The rides aren't the greatest, but there are some fun ones to hit, especially Mystic Manor! The Tarzan area was closed when we visited, so sadly we did not get to explore that.

The parades were great and viewing easy if there 15 20 mins early. Free water fountains by toilet areas but we bought bottled, about 12 70ml over the day (4 of us sharing) as sooooo humid and hot. Not great for adrenaline junkies as only 2 3 big rides but out 11&13 yr olds still enjoyed. Queued to meet one princess but Donne there early as only out in the heat for about 15 mins at a time.

Lines were short, fast passes were readily available (though unnecessary), facilities (Park and Explorer's Lodge Hotel) were immaculate, and Cast Members exuded the Disney magic! Our longest wait time of the day was 20 minutes for RC Racer. We did Hyper Space Mountain, Iron Man, Mystic Manor, and Grizzly Gulch multiple times. We Fastpassed Winnie the Pooh, just for the sake of doing a Fastpass, but it really wasn't necessary as the hotel had given us 6 priority access passes. We only used 4 of the priority passes throughout the day. Lines were orderly and the Park was very clean. The food offerings at the Park were quite good too! We tried for the Mango Dole Whip at Jessie's Snack Roundup, but they didn't seem to carry it any longer. Instead we had the pineapple smoothie with ice cream and a churro on the side. Both were very good! We ate at the Starliner Diner for lunch, it's typical Disney quick service.We took a cab from HKG to Explorer's Lodge, but took the MTR back into the city after our Disney visit. The cab was around 145 HKD, while the MTR to the city was around 60 HKD (2 adults and one child).Like most Disney Parks (except Shanghai Disney), we were truly sad to leave Hong Kong Disneyland, and hope to be back soon!",Disneyland_HongKong

Just like the Hong Kong Ocean Park, I personally wish that the shows were done in English rather than Cantonese.

The crowds are mostly from mainland China, and most of them would probably try to jump queue, if not they'd stand really close behind you whilst you're waiting in line for no apparent reason.Even if you're not participating in any of the rides, make sure to prepare yourself with an umbrella, hat, water and sunscreen.

Getting to Disneyland was easy and the rides were also pretty great. You can get a fast pass for some of the rides where there is a long wait or you could go for other rides in the meantime. The only downside for this was that, it was not available for all the rides and you had to wait for it no matter what, which was frustrating and tiring. The universal studios in Singapore had a better system where you could get an express pass by paying extra and skip the ques and save on a good 2 3 hours. The weather is also known to change pretty quick so remember to get an umbrella. The cost for the tickets was around 600 HKD pp and it was cheaper to buy the tickets at the airport.

The Fantasyland is the best, next is the Tomorrowland and the Magical shows. Inside Disneyland, there are good enough restaurants, food prices are of course high. Comfort rooms are airconditioned, so that as you go around, you will find comfort in their comfort rooms. The only thing that is a drawback was the comfort rooms were not consistently attended to by janitors because most of these smelled of urine. It was a Tuesday when we went there, expectedly there were not too many people but alas, there were a lot of guests. Nevertheless, I'm giving two thumb up to this place.

512543576,5,2017-8,Switzerland,"We went there with 5 kids and 4 adults. It was lots of fun. You can go with even small kids to good rides, for most of the rides you just have to be 1.04m. Stay until the parade around 4pm. Its great and you see all the stars like M.Mouse, Timon&Pumba, Toy Story etc",Disneyland_HongKong
512445906,5,2016-9,Philippines,We went there September and the weather is hot but not so hot around 25C but it's fine. There's still wind as you wander around the Disney. It's like we're kids again and our favorite part was the Disney fireworks. Food is expensive and other rides is until 5 6pm so check out the schedule so you won't miss anything.

512395501,4,2017-7,United States,"Went to Shanghai Disneyland what a big difference when we went to Hong Kong Disneyland. It's like night and day!! Less crowded the people are not rude, no cutting lines everyone waits their turn. Really enjoyed seeing the Tarzan play it highlighted the Chinese acrobatic talent. That was probably my favorite show at Disneyland. Because it is not crowded we were able to see and cover more of the park in less hours. We only had time for about half day   4 hours and it was plenty enough time to cover what we wanted to see and do. All in all this is a pleasant experience and worth going to visit despite everyone saying it's so small and not worth it. Believe it I enjoyed myself here more than Shanghai Disneyland. Thumbs up for Hong Kong Disneyland and the people have more class here and wait patienty their turn.",Disneyland_HongKong

512072548,3,2017-8,Italy,The park is limited with its restaurants and outlets you can't even get a bottle of water without waiting in line !! And shouldn't water be free ...? The rides are outdated and old style compared to other theme parks ... the worst was the Spider Man adventure !! You wait in line cooking for an hour just to be shuttled into a closed 2 x 2 room with a Chinese guy dressed in a Spider Man suit who only speaks Chinese and asks if you want a photo and that's it!! Seriously ?? Disney you are off my list ...hands down worst ever ,Disneyland_HongKong
511993586,5,2016-9,Philippines,Disneyland will really make you go back to ur childhood days. It was awesome to see Snow White and Mickey Mouse. It will make u proud as well to see Filipinos performing in the parade. Just that the price of the food inside the park are not reasonable.,Disneyland_HongKong
511886399,3,2017-7,United Kingdom,"After been to Orlando last year guess hard to try compare , its small just 1 park , about half size of Paris , ideal for children under 8 , apart from the thunder mountain ride rest were tame , the boat trip was ok and we liked the haunted house but rest was mainly young kids rides , this definitely needs some new rides , there was no interactive rides , could be improved loads . It was easy to get to from our hotel in Kowloon about 10 15 mins to the disney stop then change to Disney train 1 stop ",Disneyland_HongKong

The park is smaller than those in Paris and Tokyo however, it was still in line with the wonderful Disney experience. The park also has loads of special offers and special discounts that you can find by signing up on their free Wifi service and staff members handing out coupons. The only downside was that we purchased a dining plan and although the  fine print  says that you can use it for ice pops at carts around the park, management failed to provide the staff at the cards with the equipment necessary to process the QR coded vouchers.",Disneyland_HongKong
511601732,2,2017-8,New Zealand,"This was my first visit to ANY Disneyland. We arrived at 10am on a Thursday morning. I expected to see larger than life characters casually walking around. I thought I'd see a HUGE Disney castle and watch my kids faces explode with excitement. I thought I'd find some healthy food options.....Alas, none of those thugs happened for us. I thought the staff would be super happy and friendly (like the Disney adverts!) but only the cleaners were. The retail staff were totally vacant!I appreciated the  fast pass  system, but wish that had been extended to other rides so our under 5yr olds didn't have to queue 30mins for a 2min ride on a teacup. The best time of day for us was the last 30mins before the park closed whilst everyone was waiting for the parade and the queues cleared. Bliss. I can't say I'll go back. Maybe staying in a hotel on site it would be better.I just left thinking we should have saved the first Disneyland for a trip to the USA....",Disneyland_HongKong
511210445,4,2017-8,Greece,Our 3rd time to HK Disneyland as an older couple. Love seeing the young people enjoying themselves. Very humid and several showers of rain. Our food at the Explorers Club Restaurant was very average and overpriced. All merchandise is too dear. Staff well trained and very polite. $28 for a bottle of water.,Disneyland_HongKong
510837104,3,2017-4,United Kingdom,"We really enjoyed Hong Kong Disney, however a few of the food outlets were closed. There was next to nothing for vegetarians or vegans. With so many of the food places not being open it made the queues worse. I think if your paying full price everything should be open. It was difficult to meet the characters, unlike when I went Florida and they were about everywhere. ",Disneyland_HongKong

It's a long day if you stay for the 9pm fireworks display and you should, it won't disappoint...Plenty of food outlets and I mean plenty, merchandise stores also. All in all a slick well run operation...Disney does it right after decades of experience you'd expect nothing less from the moment you step on the Disney train with the Mickey Mouse ears...One worthy note, the fast track tickets are only valid at specific times for rides and attractions. You may arrive at an attraction only to find a sign saying come back in an hour...as with most places in HK if you visit at the W E or public holiday, there's gonna be long queues. Try to visit midweek...",Disneyland_HongKong

But, HK Disney is still Disneyland : ) My only comment would have to be that some of the shows were in Chinese, because it is in HK! but they could have considered that there are many foreigners too who would have loved Mickey Mouse to speak in English not in Mandarin (?). But all in all, still loved Disneyland!!!!",Disneyland_HongKong
510252803,3,2017-7,United Kingdom,I love Disney parks so when I was in Hong Kong found it necessary to visit. However I was underwhelmed compared with other parks I have visited. I felt like it lacked atmosphere and didn't have as many rides as I would have expected. Food outlets were limited and I wouldn't recommend the western food. The staff were friendly. This is the only Disney park I haven't felt the  magic  and probably wouldn't return there. ,Disneyland_HongKong

The day started with monsoon like rain that cooled off the weather for a while. We were able to see ride all the attractions without the outrageous lines in the USA. The Lion King and Mickeys Wonderous Book had exceptional live performers, especially Elsa. She sounded just like the movie",Disneyland_HongKong
509863604,1,2017-8,United States,"Embarrassed for Mr. Walt Disney. The park was created in 2005. Disney had a blank slate to create a world class park. Instead they created an embarrassing tourist trap, that offered an uninspiring place to capture your money only. If Walt was alive he would have fired the person in charge of new park development.... Don't waste your time and don't waste your money at this park. No wonder The Hong Kong park is losing millions of $$ each year..now they have finally decided to invest big money staring in 2019 to rehab this place.. we live in Los Angeles and have been to Disneyland many many times..and are very proud of the park..but HK big joke",Disneyland_HongKong

Full marks for the ease of getting there using MTR and the special connection.We went on a Friday and it was quite comfortable. I imagine at a weekend during school holidays it will get very crowded, but we were able to get on all the things we wanted to without big queues.One or Two day passes are on sale. I cannot see how it could take more than one day to do everything, even with children in tow. In all a very pleasant day out.",Disneyland_HongKong
509570313,5,2017-6,Australia,We had a absolute amazing time here and I highly recommend it for young families. To get the full feel of the park I would suggest two days so kids can have a couple turns on the rides. We did a morning to early afternoon for the first day and then a late afternoon till the end of night fireworks the second day and it was well worth it. International travellers should definitely take advantage staying at one of the 3 resorts which offer free shuttles all day long.,Disneyland_HongKong

509157718,3,2017-7,United Kingdom,Went with our 10yr old on what we hoped would not be a rainy day. It is a nice park and easy to get round. We went mid week so the queues for the rides were quite small and there was enough variety to keep her interest. We arrived about 1 2hr after it opened and we had about 4 1 2hrs before it started to rain. A few of the rides were kept open and only lightening made them stop completely. We stayed till the end anyway and saw the fireworks but the parade was cancelled. If you get there when it opens & stay the full day I don't think you need more than a day to get round but if it's busy and you have young children 2 days might be better.,Disneyland_HongKong
509080878,3,2017-7,Malaysia,"Went there in July 2017. The weather was very hot and the park was extremely crowded. I recommend you to buy tickets and meals voucher via online to get the best price.

509077350,4,2017-6,Thailand,"It's the first time me and my wife had went to Hong Kong Disneyland and I must say the whole experience from start to end was a really magical one. Although the rides do not have the same thrill and excitement level as compared to Ocean Park, HK Disneyland well makes up for it in other ways bringing out your inner child with the familiarity of the Disney franchises. We really love some of the rides like the big grizzly mountain runaway mine, RC car, Disney express, mystic manor and it's a small world. Not to mention the parade and firework finale which was both the highlight of our visit at the theme park.Compliments also to the staff for the efficient crowd control during the fireworks. We thought that they did a pretty good job keeping the situation in order despite the huge crowd. ",Disneyland_HongKong

508463324,4,2017-8,Australia,"I went on the Chinese holiday and it was hot and extremely busy. Put my bags in their holding area (at a charge) then walked further down to the entry area and lined up for an hour to get in. Every ride had a sign saying 70 or 80 minute wait. Saw a hot dog at a vendor, the only thing in the whole park I liked to eat and after lining up for 40 mins, when I asked fir one they say  sold out, sorry I walked around in the hot hot sun in and out of all the people and then left. Was not a great particular day for me to go. ",Disneyland_HongKong

508392418,4,2017-8,Australia,Amazing park perfect for young children maybe not so much young adults but as not many adult rides. My kids absolutely loved it from the rides to meeting their favorite characters. To be expected everything is expensive costing near $5 aud for water. But its a smaller very well maintained park with alot smaller wait times then the Anaheim park. Loved it. The only reason its 4 not 5 is prices.,Disneyland_HongKong
508277314,4,2017-7,Netherlands,"Probably not the best idea to visit Disney when it's 36 degrees Celsius. But we enjoyed our day at the park. Not as much big roller coasters as in the other disneyparks. Lines were not too long, longest about 30 minutes. The new Marvel attractions are great. Because of the humid and hot weather we decided to leave early so we didn't catch the light show.",Disneyland_HongKong

508101644,3,2017-8,New Zealand,I was really looking forward to HK Disney for my daughter's 5th birthday but felt a bit let down by the experience. The queues were too long and there were no princesses or charterers to be seen except at the end in the parade. The staff were not very cheerful and people pushed in all the time in the lines. They should have a priority queue for people with young kids as it seems unfair that all these adults are taking up the queue space while kids have to stand exhausted in the lines. Also the Disney characters were nowhere to be seen. Standing in queues with small children for a 5 minute ride is not that fun! Still my daughter enjoyed it! I remember Disney LA and euro Disney being much better.,Disneyland_HongKong

507454812,4,2017-1,Thailand,"We went just after they open the Iron man ride. Kids loved it! we even went twice. A good tip is to go during the week day, and avoid the national holiday, and school holiday, as it get very crowded. By going during the week, we barely wait more than 5 min per ride. Don't miss the new StarWars mountain, steeper, and faster than the Space mountains.",Disneyland_HongKong
507251039,5,2017-5,United States,"Took the Metro from hotel to Disney. You take the Metro to the Disney line   then get on trains that are decked out with Mickey Ears windows and Disney character statues inside the train. Our car was covered in blue fabric with white walls. Very clean and fun for all to experience.Arrive at Disney and walk to the entrance    with security checks before entry to the park. As we were seniors, we got the cheapest rate in HK$. We felt this price is cheaper than what we pay to enter the parks at Disneyland or DisneyWorld.We were amazed at how clean the park was    how friendly the people were and because we were American's, everyone wanted to take their photo with us. Cell phones are everywhere. Seem to be glued to their hands, just like here in America! So now we are in lots of photo albums there in China!There are a few Disney characters who come out   but be warned they don't do autographs. Pin trading is something new to them so not many people trade; however, the Disney crew did have the lanyards for those of us who are traders! The majority of the pins were what you see at the US parks, but we were able to chat with a few crew and one of them was a trader who traded a really nice pin she had collected for one of ours that we had brought with us. So it was fun.Duffy is the popular character it seems    but that might be because Easter. Spring and Easter was the theme parks decor while we were there.It rained off and on that day but the weather was hot, so the brief showers brought out umbrellas, of which we had none, so we just walked around in the rain to cool off! Went on 2 rides, walked around to enjoy the experience and ate lunch before leaving the park about 3 to take the metro back to the hotel.A great place for kids of all ages naturally, but there were a lot of families there with young children and teens out on Spring break, Also we as senior kids!There is a Pandora charm store on location with all the Disney Pandora charms available for purchase.",Disneyland_HongKong

It wasn't busy at all when we went and we were able to do everything we wanted to do TWICE! The grizzly bear ride was amazing!!! Hyper space mountain was killer. I recommend doing this. Especially if you're a Disney freak like I am! Make sure you get treats from the confectionary. They have really yummy treats you don't get to try in America.",Disneyland_HongKong

The tips dat i cud quote which we used in this travel are1) we took out the complete map of disneyland and decided the approx time we wanted to spend in each area.2) although u wish to stay n breathe n njoy the surroundings but i promise u vl miss on alot of stuff so Rush!!3) u should not at all wear high heels or ne sort of uncomfortable boots or heels and must carry small racksacks (shoulder bags) for water n stff. Wear smthng cool n smart.4) we are pure vegetarians so by majboori we had no tym to waste on tryng food stfs5) enter ur first choice from right or left. It is tomorrowland or main street usa resp. I vl prfr tomorrowland cz u vl wsh fr sm small rides n nice views and then u cn follow the road.6) best part  spread.. we made our parents stand separately in queues of different rides so dat on njoyng one we cd run for another. Also one shd avoid rushy areas.. i.e. Dnt enter whr rush is entering. After sometime you will find it a lot easier space to njoy.DONT WASTE TYMDo njoy the night show. Dnt wrry abt takng d frst place near the boundary lines of the castle.. its fire crackers so focus on wats happng overhead,Disneyland_HongKong
506958560,5,2017-7,China,Hong Kong Disneyland is fantastic! It captures all of the traditional Disney elements whilst also putting it's own spin on things. The park is incredibly easy to navigate and well set out.Waits times are sooooooo much less here than at other Disneyland Resorts around the World.

506337938,5,2017-5,Philippines,"Disneyland was indeed the happiest place I've been when I was in Hongkong. Although it was quite far from the place we were staying still, I enjoyed so much even from the start of the travel. They had their own Disney train where you can sit in a luxurious seat. The place was amazing. It would bring back childhood memories and it would cast away your worries. Parade of colors were nice. We actually witnessed two parades, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The fireworks were definitely wonderful. A place where there's no time to get bored. Definitely a happy place for family and friends... ",Disneyland_HongKong
506329203,3,2017-5,United States,"A one day pass for HK Disney cost us about $100 USD per person, which, for what you get, isn't really worth the cost. If you've already seen Disney World and or Disneyland in the US, HK Disney may disappoint you. Comparatively, it's very small. It's basically a tiny Magic Kingdom without many of the classic rides   no Pirates of the Caribbean, Splash Mountain, etc.There are a couple of rides exclusive to HK Disney that are pretty neat. In particular, Mystic Manor is a very fun, smartly designed Haunted Mansion esque ride that I'd highly recommend.Disney fanatics might also want to check out some of the merchandise. There's more than enough of it, and much of it is exclusive to HK Disney.The food is much nicer fancier than the Disney parks food in the US, but it's also considerably more expensive.Getting there via the MTR was fairly easy, though it's a bit of a hike from Hong Kong Island or Kowloon. Getting back was a bit more difficult, since we left with the hordes of other people leaving right after the fireworks show that begins as the park closes. (The show was great, for what it's worth.)We went on a Tuesday, and there weren't many crowds or long lines. The park actually felt oddly empty. Then again, we were there on a holiday (Dragon Boat Festival), which may have kept a lot of people away, so take that with a grain of salt.",Disneyland_HongKong

Visit Disney on a weekday when there are fewer visitors (but don't underestimate the word 'fewer'). It is best to be in front of the ticket booths before 9:30AM so that you can join the impatient visitors who make a mad dash to the nearest attractions once they open at 10AM. And that's exactly what we did. Tomorrowland (Space Mountain, Iron Man, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters in succession). Then off to Toy Story Land (Toy Soldier Parachute Drop, RC Racer Roller Coaster, Slinky Dog Spin) , then to Grizzly Gulch (Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (my favorite!). So many more rides, so little time.Don't forget to watch The Lion King Show (various times), Philharmagic (4D), the Disney Characters Parade at 4:00PM, the Light the Night Parade at 8:00PM, and the Fireworks Display at 9:00PM.At P3,800  (HK$589), a one full day trip to Disneyland will always be worth every peso (or dollar) you pay.",Disneyland_HongKong

Please make sure you go to Toy Story Land to play the attraction first. Because the waiting time for Toy Story Land is more than 60 mins. Then only go get the fast pass ticket for the Iron Man Attraction Hyper Space Mountain Winnie The Pooh attraction. Lastly, make sure you wait till the end to watch the fireworks, it was super nice.",Disneyland_HongKong
505352119,5,2017-7,United States,"We love Hong Kong Disneyland. This is a much different than the Anaheim resort. The meal deal is an exceptional value and Space Mountain, StarWars edition is better at the Hong Kong Resort. Grizzly Gulch runaway train is the very best ride. We loved the Lion King live show and the other shows. The variety of foods should be available in Anaheim along with the discount senior admission. The customer service is amazing and the air conditioned waiting areas for the major attractions are amazing. It may be smaller but the customer service and prices makes this the best Disney Resort.",Disneyland_HongKong
505279192,4,2017-7,Australia,A lovely small Park with plenty of adventures waiting for young Children. My 4 year old and 3 year old sons haven't stopped talking about it since. Plenty to see and do with a good variety of World wide cuisines,Disneyland_HongKong

Basically, just as expected from a Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong
504629826,4,2017-7,Singapore,"We visited this place 10 years ago with our girls , most of it are the same except one or two new land ( like the Toy story ) .It was very hot becos it is summer , and everyone will look for a air conditioner cafe but there are not many plus it is Jam pack with loads of tourists. if you have young children , it is better to bring an umbrella with a portable fan for each child . Q up for rides and show is not really that long but for some famous ride , it will take up about half hour to an hour Q up time , sometime the area is not air condition so do remember to have water and some snacks for kids to keep them entertained .If you are travelling with young children , do remember when the last show ends , there will be a lot of them leaving together, so it will take up at lest half hour trying to go to their Disney train b4 changing to MTR , so your travel time to go home will now be at lest half more than your original time .",Disneyland_HongKong
504343629,3,2017-7,Australia,For kids who are looking for rides with a little thrill this place leaves a lot to be desired. Overall not a great place to visit but been there done that may apply.Food is expensive and service is lacking. Very difficult to find a young person smiling outside of the performers. The other thing is just a heads up. Many of the rides or exhibits that have voiceovers don't have great English. We could barely understand which detracted from the experience. Not complaining just worth noting if you are expecting all communication to be understood.The lines were not that bad but we went on a Friday.,Disneyland_HongKong
504327918,2,2016-8,Hong Kong,"Disneyland is a fantasy for everyone, guess everybody read and watch about the stories and surely would like to see it in person. That's why everybody is excited about Disneyland. Especially those ones in Western World. However, the one in Hong Kong was too small to put everything together. Therefore they can only selected some themes they thought can attract more visitors. Unfortunately they failed. Once can compare with those one in France or US, You will found the one in Hong Kong is waste of time to visit, you will encounter only queuing but without fun. Further, you will be pushed to dine within the site and found they are robbing you. But in a while if you have nothing to do and have spare money in your pocket then you can tell your friends that you have been one more Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong
504091022,5,2017-7,Bahrain,It was truly a great experience. We had a 2 day pass. Iron man experience was the best enjoyed by my 14 year old son. Since it was july we were disturbed lot by rain. But still it was exciting. The Tarzan tree house and the raging river rides were quite a different experience. Monkey's philar magic was simply out of the world. I am truly left short of words to describe.,Disneyland_HongKong
503964199,5,2017-7,United States,"Disclosure: I grew up near Walt Disney World (WDW) and have been there 100  times. I only recently visited the original Disneyland, and then a few days later visited Hong Kong Disneyland for the first time. Overall Impression: My husband and I really enjoyed this park, and it was our favorite when compared to Disneyland Anaheim or California Adventure. It's much smaller than WDW, but that is part of what makes it charming. Travel: We rode the Disneyland Express MTR, which was adorable. The Mickey windows and various Disney details on the train cars were adorable. That said, we opted for a cab on the way home to avoid the need for several trains. There is a cab area with clear designations about which cabs go to which parts of Hong Kong.Best Rides:Mystic Manor     I have a love affair with the Haunted Mansion, so I was surprised when I ended up loving Mystic Manor even more. One of the best rides I   ve ever done at any Disney park. There   s a lot of great story which is a nice bonus, but really the ride itself just really unique. I   ve never been on anything quite like it. It   s trackless, and the mansion just feels HUGE and grandiose in a way I wasn   t expecting. We loved it so much we rode it twice.Hyperspace Mountain     To be fair, we didn   t ride Space Mountain at Disneyland, in part because the Hyperspace Mountain elements were already removed from that one. But Hyperspace Mountain at HKD was AWESOME. There   s something to be said for rocketing off with Star Wars music blaring, and tie fighters and X Wings shooting all around you. So much fun we rode it twice.Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars     So many twists and turns with this coaster that were unexpected and a lot of fun. At first glance it looked like a Big Thunder Mountain copy cat, but it was SO much better than that.Iron Man Experience     This was a pretty classic simulator, but we enjoyed it quite a bit. Lots of fun, and not nearly as    jerky    as Star Tours. In fact, I thought the ride was pretty smooth and enjoyable, whereas a lot of simulators usually leave me feeling a little sick.Honorable Mentions: The Festival of the Lion King show at HDK. Not a ride, but a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I had never done this at Animal Kingdom, and with HK being so horribly hot and humid in summer, it was a perfect break. Food thoughts: We ate lunch in Tomorrowland. My husband got an Iron Man burger that actually had the Iron Man helmet logo on the bun. I got fried chicken, which came with little plastic gloves to keep your hands from getting messy. Never seen that before, but helpful!Lines and Crowds: We visited Hong Kong Disneyland on a Friday. We never waited more than 30 minutes for anything. For Hyperspace Mountain we walked right on the first time with barely a 5 minute wait. We did pass up some Marvel meet and greets due to 60 minute wait times though. Getting food at all three parks was surprisingly painless. No long lines for food and no stalking tables to find a spot to eat. ",Disneyland_HongKong
503933901,5,2017-7,Philippines,Had my my kids 4th birthday here. Had 1 week to be around Hong Kong but made sure to spend majority of our stay here. Checked in the disney hotel and spent 2 nights. The best thing about disneyland is seeing your kid have an unlimited fun. That is priceless,Disneyland_HongKong
503869280,5,2017-7,United Kingdom,"Loved, loved, loved this place! We visited as a family with my thirteen year old and I wasn't sure if he would be too old. This was a needless worry as he lost the teenage attitude immediately and to my horror, introduced me to his idea of roller coaster heaven.There's a wide range of rides to suit most children and in particular enough for young children to be happy (and the parents who don't like the scary rides).Note that you are not allowed to take food or drink into the park and bags are searched. Some of our party were turned away to dispose of this. I understand for commercial reasons that this is to encourage buying within the park.Each area is different   fantasyland, tomorrow and, adventure land. I recommend The Lion King show. The singing and visuals were superb.We visited on a day of very mixed weather and with very little notice, the afternoon parade was cancelled. My impression is that they readily cancel parades here if the weather isn't good. The evening parade and the fireworks more than made up for this though. It's very easy to get to and is part of Lantau Island. The MTR from Hong Kong stops at Sunnybay where you take the Disneyland express MTR to the park. Everything Disney starts here with the cut out Mickey Minnie windows on the train.We wished we had bought a two day pass instead of one day. There's only   5 difference in ticket price. I would definitely come back here on a future trip to Hong Kong.",Disneyland_HongKong

503594935,5,2016-8,Hong Kong,First of all speak to the locals in town at your hotel maybe as all employees at d land get free daily access to family and friends .that will save you at least half the fee .also make the local very happy also no queues.Secondly take a packed lunch or have a big breakfast for the price and quality of food and drinks you may as well go to the real one in USA.It's great for kids split into 2 groups as to see what everyone wants faster and no hanging around because one person wants to ride the train .etc etc etc .on the way back to hk stop of at kowloon area to see pet street with the real Mac oh. Eat around there and get a filling freash and tasty meal cheaply .or go and see the light show at eight or nine pm I think .please check.All in all a fun and tiring day take a buggy for the small one and sensible Sun hats and protection,Disneyland_HongKong

503538782,1,2017-7,United Kingdom,"On the day, it was a choice of either Ocean Park or Disneyland. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, we decided to go to disneyland. Travelling there was pretty easy by MTR and rail. However, on the way, we were met by hordes of Chinese mainlanders, each going to the same destination. They are loud and rude and where there is a queue, they will certainly try to skip it. Sadly, this was the main theme throughout the day. After queuing at the entrance, and fighting off every single mainlander's attempt to jump the queue, we finally got in. The sun was shining and it was extremely hot. My advice is to take an umbrella or parasol with you to shade yourself, because there is very little shade indeed within the park. Queuing for the rides wasn't so bad. They are pretty fast, and you can select a time to return to save yourself some time. This is certainly what you must do for the more popular rides. The rides are generally suitable for children and even those who are afraid of rollercoasters can enjoy them without a fuss. But you must ensure that no one skips in front of you while queuing. Since there are no shades within the park, you are always on the lookout for a shop to relieve yourself with aircon. Although, there are some areas with aircon, there are also many shops that don't have it. I find it pretty cheap that they can't even turn the aircon on after you pay so much to get in.The food courts are jammed pack. You'd be extremely lucky to get a seat. The mainlanders all rush to get their food and the whole place is absolutely chaotic. It's probably the worse experience you will ever have. Fortunately, they serve the food pretty quickly and you don't have to wait long in the queue.By the end of the day, I was so knackered, I just couldn't move anymore. The heat, the exhaustion, the constant need to fight off queue jumping. Chinese mainlanders will not observe any etiquette and it got me completely mad. I cannot recommend this experience to anyone.",Disneyland_HongKong
503503315,5,2017-6,India,Cutely smaller in size but perfect for a day outing with kids (3 years   99 years) there is every thing for everyone. Do stay till the end to watch the parade and lighting crackers show,Disneyland_HongKong
503473599,5,2017-6,India,"This is the world's smallest Disneyland but still it manages to give you one of the best experiences of life. It caters to all age groups and hence it is great fun to be in. There is a lot to walk once you are inside so if you are travelling with kids make sure to get a pram. There are different shows as well like the Lion King show, etc. but they take place only at particular time points so make sure you plan accordingly and don't miss the shows. There are two parades which take place inside the park one in the afternoon at around 3 and the second in the evening at around 7, both of them are equally great, so one should try and attend both. The fire works show happens in the night at around 8:30 and that too is worth watching. It is recommended to keep yourself hydrated all day as it is pretty hot in the month of June in Hong Kong. An amazing overall experience.",Disneyland_HongKong
503235271,3,2017-7,Philippines,"The month of July is not a very ideal time to visit Hong Kong. It was raining the day we arrived in Hong Kong and on the day that we are supposed to be visiting HK Disneyland, it rained 75% of the time. My little one whose 5 years old still was able to enjoy the Disney park special thanks to other Disney characters who bravely came out to Fantasy Garden to greet us despite of unfortunate rainy condition. The Disney Parade was cancelled and of course the fire works. We were disappointed but not that much, my little princess was still able to enjoy the tour at  It's a small world , which I believe is the second highlights of her very first visit to HK Disneyland. You can't really do anything if Mother nature wants to rain. BUT I can still try to come back next time with my little princess and I am hoping in December it'll be a different experience...a much more enjoyable and worth Disney vacation. I am still giving HK Disneyland a 5 star ratings because if it didn't rained, I know my little princess would have enjoyed the Disney tour. ",Disneyland_HongKong

If you visit the park during the rainy season, bring your rain poncho or buy it from the park (kids size 60 HKD). Fireworks in the end are worth of seeing. ",Disneyland_HongKong

There are plenty of rides for all ages. Make sure you read the guide at the beginning of your day and plan your day well to see as many performances as you can.The food is terrible and overprice but that always happens with theme parks. Remember to pack some extra water and snacks to sustain you throughout the day. Make sure to bring lots of money because everything is so cute and you will probably end up buying lots of souvenirs.If you're going to Hong Kong then definitely set aside a day to visit Disneyland.

When my wife bought me and two of our (older) kids tickets to Disneyland, though, we embraced the chance to go, and it was a wonderful experience for which we are and will remain grateful. Due to some time constraints we got to enjoy five rides, namely the Iron Man Experience, the Runaway Mine Carts, the Mystic Manor, the Toy Story Parachute Drop and the Toy Story RC racer. As long as the lines we had to endure were, it was still time well spent. We particularly enjoyed the Mystic Manor and the Disneyland HK exclusive Iron Man Experience, which we rode before anything else. As virtual 4 D rides go, it was a topnotch experience, though the more traditional rides were also quite enjoyable. The staff were very friendly and very helpful, and the food, while pricey, was nonetheless good, with a good range of variety (East Asian and Southeast Asian cuisine), and generous servings. The layout of the place is very friendly and easy to cover by foot so it shouldn't even be that hard for small children to get around, though given the size of the crowd it's really advisable to keep an eye on smaller kids.I can definitely see myself going back, perhaps when my younger kids are big enough for the rides.",Disneyland_HongKong

500960346,5,2017-6,United States,"Disneyland Hong Kong (a Thursday in June 2017) from the Royal Plaza Hotel in Mongkok was easy to get to by MTR (purchase an Octopus card). It was about a 35min ride. It was about $75 US dollars for 1day admission (tickets purchased at the park). The one day pass is enough to see most of the park. It was a very hot sticky day. I suggest a lot of sunscreen, dri fit clothes, a cooling towel, water, and an umbrella (especially its typhoon season and you never know when it will rain). It says online that a selfie stick is not allowed but we saw many with them. You can bring your own water, but no canned or glass bottles. There is security check. The staff or cast members as they are called, are not so friendly as SoCal Disney and Disneyworld Florida. They have  Western  bathrooms and they have seat covers and toilet paper (if you have ever been around China, you know why I mentioned this). They also take Visa charge cards. It is about a third of the size of Disneyland SoCal. We got there about 10:30am. The park is sectioned off similar to Disneyland SoCal, Tomorrowland, Fantasyland, Adventureland are a few familiar areas. The Disney Characters do not walk around the park. On Main Street, they have a couple of designated areas that they give guest picture opportunities. I don't blame them, who would want to walk around in that costume in weather such as Hong Kong. The Winnie the Pooh ride had a really long line, which is ironic because the Winnie the Pooh ride in California has the shortest line. We decided to skip this ride. Grizzly Gulch seems to be the most thrilling compared to the other rides. Mystic Manor was my favorite ride, but then again I'm not big on rollercoasters. Ironman was a good ride too. The lines for the other rides are not too long, about 30 minutes wait. The shows are great, especially Lion King (A C was heaven). The park seemed to get a little busier at around 5:30pm. We guess the locals are off work. We stayed right before the park closed (10:30am  8pm). The park hours that day was 10 9pm) we didn't want to wait till after the ending parade then we would be with a large crowd on the MTR (watch out for pickpocketers). We had a good time.

500558417,1,2016-9,United States,I have been to Disney World in Florida once and Disneyland in Californis numerous times. Both are world class entertainment facilities for young and old alike. Hong Kong`s version is a bad joke and a total rip off. Save your money. For this style of entertainment go to Ocean Park on Hong Kong Island. It is light years better.,Disneyland_HongKong

500548624,5,2017-7,United Arab Emirates,"Highly recommended place for families with all ages. Don't miss the shows and parades they are essential part of the Disney experience.Great quality of the available rides.Lots of interesting souvenirs can be found here from clothing, toys, accessories jewelry, sweets  cookies ...etc.The Marvel super heroes summer events in 2017 is another plus.I can't compare it to the other Disney lands, as I haven't been in any of them yet, however, it's a worthy place to visit if you happened to be in Hong Kong.I would suggest to the park management to consider having more halal food items (even though it exists; more variety would be better)",Disneyland_HongKong
500524617,5,2017-3,Canada,Hong Kong Disney is fabulous ! It's smaller than other parks but less busy and we got on every ride ! The longest we waited was 15 minutes. I met Tinkerbell and Elsa and they were perfect. It was rainy to start so no one else was there but the weather cleared up and we walked the entire park 3 times. The food was delicious I had butter chicken and it was amazing !! ,Disneyland_HongKong
500472562,5,2017-6,United States,"I go to the the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, CA very often (I am an annual pass holder) so I was very excited to visit Hong Kong Disneyland. I was very happy with what they have at HK Disneyland. Hyperspace Mountain is my favorite ride in Anaheim so I was very happy to find out that the one in HK was very similar and just as entertaining. I also loved the Iron Man ride in HK Disneyland. It is very similar to the Star Tours version that they have in Anaheim. The snacks there are quite pricey but my cousin and my sister were very happy to find snacks that were good. My sister got the Korean squid that you can purchase around the park and that was very good. I got the churro sundae in Toy Story Land and I really liked it. Especially because it was so hot in HK. Another ride that me, my sister and my cousin liked was the Grizzly Bear Mountain Cars ride. It is a great ride and should be one that everyone aims to go on. It was a good trip, don't forget to drink a lot of water. The train ride to the park is very convenient. I look forward to going again!",Disneyland_HongKong

500088490,5,2017-2,Indonesia,"I spent 1 day full for visiting this place because this place offers fun and great times. My favorite ride is toy story land and the mystic manor! This place is suitable for children until adults. I suggest to buy a 1 day full ticket including free meal for each person because it saves a lot of money! For the transportation i suggest you to take a fast train (disneyland train) from your nearby station, it quite far so be ready for transit and stops. But overall isn't hard to follow the map!  Hope you enjoy your trip!!",Disneyland_HongKong
500056784,5,2016-11,Philippines,"Hongkong Disneyland is just a must see destination especially for families and parents with kids. I was never a fan of rides and amusement parks, but Hongkong Disneyland somehow captured the kid in me. Lol. We had a great time enjoying the rides and the shops were captivating and irresistible. You just want to buy those souvenirs and take them home. But just a tip though  make sure to check the weather prior to your visit. It rained when we went there so it's best to bring a raincoat, especially for kids. The food are bit pricey but there are lots of choices when it comes to dining. Also, make sure to stay till 8pm to watch the parade and the fireworks! It was truly magical!",Disneyland_HongKong
499927245,5,2016-8,India,This was our first  Disneyland  experience. My 5 year son enjoyed every bit of it but was exhausted by the end of day because of his over excited parents behaving like kids and doing ride hopping without a break. For all of us this was the first visit to Disney and we wanted to cover each and every attraction. By the end of first day we realised that there is just too much to see in just one visit even with a 2 full day park access. However we had a ball of a time and this visit motivated us to visit the disneyland in paris a year later,Disneyland_HongKong
499901740,5,2017-7,United States,"Visited Hong Kong Disneyland today and had a real good time. Iron Man ride was great along with Hyperspace Mountain. Mystic Manor was my favorite. The Disney staff was great and also friendly cant say the same for some of the rude patrons you will meet but all in all it was a great time. I will say it is brutally hot and humid in HK but while there were lines, there are also lots of shade and fans to add some relief. The indoor rides has ice cold air conditioning to give your body the respite it need to keep on going. Get fast pass. The lines build up quick.",Disneyland_HongKong

Queues can be a little long so either get there early or attempt to get some queue jump tickets which are given out. Alot to do in one day so maybe spread over two days.

Impressive quality of the rides & details of the toys, castle, etc.. everything was very expensive though (souvenirs & food).

499017677,5,2017-6,India,"In Hong Kong, we eagerly awaited for the most sought after tour of Disneyland, the true fantasy filled wonderland, the Fantasyland! Little far from the city, our tour operator organised our transfer, and after nearly an hour   s drive from North Point, we were at the gates of the Disneyland by 10.30 am. Here again, it started to rain heavily as soon as we arrived, but thankfully rains were always in short spells, which allowed everyone to enjoy the Disneyland to the fullest. Everyone out here are so used to such intermittent rains that they are always ready with Umbrellas and rainwear. Inside Disneyland, the rides, shows, theatre, trains are all spectacular. The beautifully designed Castle, which is the universally famous and most prominent and recognised mark of Disneyland and people identify with, appears like a dream sequence, very warmly welcomes you inside the Disneyland. The fantasyland is vast and expansive and is always brimming with visitors, all through the year. But despite such heavy deluge of visitors   the infrastructure, queue systems, the facilities, the layout, the flow of everything is so well managed   that never once anyone bumps on to or rubs shoulder with any other person! Access to every ride and entertainment shows are super quick, hassle free and easily accessible. Once inside, you are on your own and free to chose your rides and shows of your liking and interest. The most interesting ones, which I checked out myself, were Tomorrow Land, Mystic Manor, Jungle River Cruise, Rail Road, Big Grizzly Mountain, Hyperspace Mountain, Iron Man Experience, RC Racer, Mickey   s Wondrous Book and The Donald Duck 3D Animation Movie Show were simply superb and a must to experience. Among these, the experience of Hyperspace, Mystic Manor and Iron Man deserve applause in particular. All the above rides and events are full of thrills, frills, super exciting and mystical, which will not only challenge your fears and imagination but also give you an out of the world adrenaline rush and adventure moments to cherish, forever. It   s a huge place. Also housing a glittering shopping arcade, selling all kinds of Disneyland memorabilia, chocolates, apparels, decors, toys, and much more! But, all very pricey!And, it   s not over yet! As the clock strikes 8pm, the grand and glittering Disney parade troupe starts to appear, one by one, passing through the winding streets right in front of the open area outside Castle facade, virtually turning into an arena, with all the visitors collecting over and coming together from all parts of the fantasyland, to witness the spectacularly eclectic and glowing mix of dance and music. After almost an hour of this truly an awestruck dazzling show, the announcement is made for the 15 minutes of the firework show, starting at 8.45pm. This firework show in the backdrop of the glorious Castle, bathing in colourful lights, generates the maximum frenzy and interest among all the visitors   the last grandest of the grand show     is the icing on the cake before curtains are down for the day and everyone goes back in happiness beholding the cheerful memories, etched forever! And, finally the ultimate moment wrapped for the last comes alive; there goes the non stop blitzkrieg of exotic fireworks: extreme, impressive, extravagant, spectacular and an amazingly colourful; much like living a dream, joy and ecstasy writ large on everyone   s smiling faces. Finally, the razzmatazz of Disneyland tour of the real fantasyland comes to a fabulous end. I return back: all amazed, dazzled and delighted.(c) Anil Bishtanilbisht@rediffmail.com",Disneyland_HongKong
499009304,4,2017-6,Singapore,"It was level 3 Typhoon warning when I went there in the morning. The staff informed us that outdoor rides close and ask we wanted to come back another day. They told us no idea when they will open. But since our itinerary was all planned, we decided to go in. After few hours, warning level escalate to 8 and we were inform Park has to close. It wasn't chaotic at all. People still strolling and looking around. Staff did I not really physically chase customer out. We quickly redeem our meal voucher and make our way out. Along the way we asked the staff and was told to keep the tickets as we can come back within 6 months with the same ticket. And so we did, on the next day afternoon, as the Typhoon came and left within a night. It was a good decision by my wife as the park is almost empty. We get to sit most of the rides without queue. Night parade and fireworks still on. But just a note that you need to go to the booth to exchange for a new ticket before entry. ",Disneyland_HongKong

498796170,5,2017-6,India,"Absolute fun to visit the Disneyland. All rides are fabulous, not to be missed is the evening parade followed with fire works. We booked on klook with meal option so could save on the regular price at the stand. Also buying online saves time by not standing in queues. One can also buy priority pass. Those who are staying in a Disney hotel nearby gets 2 complimentary pass as part of the package. Disneyland Hong Kong is well connected with MTR, with its own station. Those who stay in Disney hotel nearby can board the shuttle every 10 minutes.",Disneyland_HongKong
498730139,5,2017-7,Australia,"This is our second trip to the park and we were very happy with our entire time. The only shame was the 1.5hrs of rain we had but this is July in Hong Kong so expect some rain. The experience entering the park was quick and painless. We decided to go us on rides and shows as it was our son's fourth birthday today. We never waited more than 20 minutes for any rides and that was refreshing not to have to line up for hours and most of the rides feature air conditioned lines. That feature is welcome as it was 29 degrees Celsius when it was not raining. The Ironman experience is a star tours ride along with Jarvis and Ironman himself. It is a good ride and the ride features a lot of Stark tech while you wait in the line. Hyperspace mountain is a great ride and after riding the hyperspace in Anaheim Disneyland this year I have to say this one is a better experience the visuals of the space battle are brighter and more defined. Mystic manor is a great ride too. It really does bring out some Disney magic using robotic cars. The only new show was Storybook theater and that was a good show with great singing dancing, sets and special effects. Food and shopping are usual for Disney parks and we bought the 3 in 1 food pass. Lunch combo and dinner combo meals with a free ice pop or caramel corn and discount on a bottled drink. Works out in your favour. You can book these on the Hong Kong Disney website under dining.We ride Hyperspace and Ironman twice, saw 3 shows and did quite a few other rides, saw the night parade and fireworks by 9:30pm. They say this park is small but honestly I was more than happy with the size and rides experiences available and never felt bored or annoyed with lineups. Oh and my son got his birthday badge from city hall. The cast members really made him feel special all day. We will definitely be visiting again.",Disneyland_HongKong
498696443,4,2017-6,Australia,"We enjoyed our family visit to Disneyland.Pros:  Excellent food court food, service and cleanliness.  Clean and spacious location.  Fast and friendly service.  The lines were not long (we visited on a weekday). Most ride wait times were 15 minutes with the maximum at 45 minutes (the scarier rides).Cons:   The park is a little dated.  The range of rides for older children is limited.I would visit again with younger children (or lovers of Disneyland).",Disneyland_HongKong
498693311,5,2017-3,New Zealand,"My friend and I recently spent 2 days in Hong Kong Disneyland (HKD) and we loved it! The whole experience started with taking the train to HKD   really loved the whole Disneyland theme throughout the train, with Mickey Mouse shaped windows and cool golden statues of well loved Disney characters throughout the train. Even the train station carried through the magical theme.Loved the rides   my all time favourite was the  It's a small world  ride where you go on a boat ride through these amazing landscapes filled with singing and dancing dolls dressed in costumes from all over the world. Don't miss the parade of singing dolls that come through the clock face right in front of the ride (I think every hour on the hour). The song does stick in your mind after a while though :)There were so many magical rides, including the Dumbo ride which made you feel like you were flying, and the Mystic Manor ride with some pretty cool special effects. Don't miss the jungle boat ride as well. For the more adventurous people, they also had the more hairy rollercoaster ride, which was fun, with everyone screaming together! :) There was a bit of a wait for some of the more popular rides, but they weren't too long. Make sure you do bring along a bottle of water and a hat (or umbrella) though. I also really loved the Storybook Theatre and the Lion King show. These were like Broadway Musicals with all your well loved Disney friends. Superb shows with lots of singing, dancing and special effects which I really enjoyed. Really enjoyed the daily parade down Main Street, the night time parade as well as the fireworks at the end of the evening!When you get hungry, there were plenty of places to eat. We had special desserts in the shape of Olaf from Frozen and there were Mickey Mouse shaped waffles etc. Not cheap, but guess to be expected.We initially thought 2 days might be a bit much, but I think you do need that extra day to fully enjoy all that HKD had to offer (not to mention that you might want to experience your favourite rides more than once). Also, be aware that some of the parades might not be carried out depending on the weather (e.g. the special nighttime parade was cancelled the 2nd night we were there due to rain).HKD was such an awesome experience that until today, just thinking of our jaunt there still brings a happy smile to my face :) Fantastic experience for both adults and kids alike.",Disneyland_HongKong

We spent the rest of the day meeting Micky and minnie, who are in more than one location at a time which I thought was great. Micky had a dance with my 7 year old which absolutely made her holiday and mine. We also met Tinker bell and rapunzel. We rode the train, went shopping,had a river tour saw a wonderful show and watched 2 parades. The night time one was lovely. I know some people think this is a small park but I thought it was so much better for being small, I personally had a much nicer time than at Florida Disney. I also found the metro really easy to use so getting to and from the park was really simple. if going in the hot season remember your umbrella for a bit of shade.",Disneyland_HongKong

I've never been able to watch a Disney parade or fireworks show and still maintain personal space like I did here. It was so nice to not have to rush to shows or attractions. There aren't as many rides as the American parks. But it does have a Star Wars version of Space Mountain and the Mystic Manor, a creative alternative to the Haunted Mansion.

Granted, it's Disney but for the size and price I don't really think it's worth it. I'd go for Ocean Park over this any day. Best time of year to visit would definitely be in the fall or winter and not the hot summer. I would suggest paying extra to get the fast pass at certain rides. Totally worth it and it tells you when to come back for no lines waiting! Of course it is going to be pricey because everything at Disney is.

497042786,3,2017-6,Indonesia,"Visit on 25 June 2017 with my family. It is not public holiday in Hongkong, but the place was still crowded. I suppose it filled with overseas tourist, especially from Indonesia, since there was long public holiday in Indonesia. My brother purchased the tickets from Singapore.The location of the park is on Lantau Island. Near the Hongkong International Airport. You need to depart on Sunny Bay station if you ride with MTR and then continue with the special line to Disneyland Hongkong.The first thing that I noticed that the station, the train was decorated with Disney Theme, which is kind of improving the holiday mood. And then when the train arrive at the Disneyland station, the MTR announcer say   Have a magical day Alongside the road to the main entrance, there were lamp with poster of Iron Man and other Marvel character. As you may know, that Marvel already been purchased by Disney, which is obviously a great advantage because now Disney can incorporate the Marvel character to their ride, which it makes the Disneyland cooler and help them to step a little bit from their kid intended ride persona. I arrived early at 8 O'clock After exchanging the booking confirmation with ticket, we queued to get the bag check. There was already queued even when the park has not yet opened. The weather is bad, with all of sudden the rain come. You should bring umbrella or raincoat. So after the bag check we queue at the front entrance. It is opened at 9 O'clock but the queue were already long. It is not really pleasant queue since the weather was really hot. There was ( which I thought a VIP family) who granted to gain early access to the park. And the family were being accompanied by some girl staff, and some Disney character and started to take photo at some landmark spot, while we still waiting before the gate open to the common people. And then the gate opened finally, but we still cannot get inside to the main area ( where are the rides located) It is opened at 9.30. I thought that is the strategy so the guest forced to roaming around first at the shops. Of course we will enter the shop since that's the only place that could prevent you from the dead from the heat. The park itself it is not too big. The rides mostly intended for kid, with no high level thrilled rides. There is no roller coaster with loop for example or with corkscrew. My favourite ride were Hyperloop coaster and Iron Man. The food here were expensive. For one plate of fried rice will cost you around 100 HKD. Despite off the portion was quite big ( enough even for 3 persons). The drink even more expensive. But they provided with free drinking water fountain in the front of every restroom.We did not finish all day in here since the weather is really bad. Hot and suddenly rain come.

Fantasyland has all the classic fairytale Disney themed characters like dumbo , sleeping beauty castle , Carousel etc. Jungle river cruise , Tarzan's tree house are interesting. Mystic manor , Winnie the pooh , Small World are cute rides for young kids. Adults older teenagers will like fast paced rides like mine cars , RC racer.

My baby fell asleep and I've requested if we could stay for a while after the session since any motion will wake her up & the heat outside was unbearable. The answer from the Disney staff was a flat no. So I had to leave with a tired baby in my arms & walk under the heat of the sun. I expected more compassion from Disney, being a family centered theme park.  Bland Chinese food from Maxim's (plus they charge for continents like soy sauce even if they serve dimsum)  Rude staff. I saw how a staff member was so rude to a certain race who was asking how much a drink cost. The staff got the price tag & slammed it in front of the customer.

But I appreciate what the inheritors of Walt Disney vision have been able to achieve. No one can deny the global significance of Disney as a cultural symbol of American talent, creativity and command of the entertainment industry. As expected they have tried to translate that experience into a more local and regional  cultural dialect . That is why we have Disney parks in France, Tokyo, Hong Kong and so on. In the end when you visit those Disney parks in foreign lands you have a kind of split personality experience. You do not really know where you are and what you are watching. If you are from the USA or from a Western country, and traveling with your family, I strongly advise you to avoid Hong Kong Disneyland. Immerse your self in providing them with a real experience of a place that most probably they will not be visiting again soon. Taking them to Disney will just make them yearn for going back home and reduce their interest in experiencing the certainly much more confusing cultural landscape of this strange lands. Going to Disneyland is quick solution to keep the kids happy. But don't be fooled. It will replace the magic of discovery for the conventional and convenient magic they are used to.

The fast lane pass was given out at specific timings but I never got to queue for it. Average wait was about 10 15 mins. The food places were all generally crowded but with the expectations of crowd n queues, it was alright. Food was quite expensive but ok. I didn't stay at the Disney hotels so we took the MTR.

Adding to our disappointment is that the ticketing was not discounted and we were not made aware at the time we purchased the tickets that half the rides would not be operating.Regrettably, for fear of the ferries closing down we left early to return to Macau (apparently we were on the second last ferry to leave Hong Kong at 1530hrs that same afternoon) and so we did not get to experience the park in full, however, we shall definitely return next time we are in Hong Kong to experience Disneyland in full :)",Disneyland_HongKong

Staff understand English (even though some of them may not fully understand you so you would need to repeat sometimes)Cons: 1. Failure of using Disney Point: Using full palm is fine but I saw cast members using one finger point when assigning line at Tomorrowland; 2. Had some really old and cold food (the Indonesian seafood fried rice combo) at Tahitian Terrace; 3. The information from the cast member here may not be necessarily correct like that in the states: for example, I asked a cast member from PhilharMagic where does the evening parade start, and he told me it started from Main Street USA which was incorrect and totally the opposite. 4. Didn't see a lot of  Disney Scoop  and saw some trash during non parade fireworks time. 5. Saw several cast members using cell phone on stage.Other thoughts: overall the cast members' energy and smile are better than those from SHDR and more responsive in general, while SHDR focuses more on Disney Point and trash free environment. It's a bummer that there's no Downtown Disney in HK. Must dos if you're a cast member from the states: Iron Man Experience   a Star Tours like ride that is about Iron Man and Hong Kong, really unique and amazingMystic Manor   A slow moving ride that is similar to Haunted Mansion with a different story settingRC Racer   just do itFestival of Lion King   more singing and less dancing compared to the one in Animal Kingdom.

All of us were over 20 yo so we had targeted rides with height warnings such as Iron Man Experience, Grizzly Gulch, Speed Racer, and Hyperspace Mountain etc. Iron Man was the most disappointing of them all, as the '4DX' movie was too short, had an unimaginative storyline and was by far the worst disney ride. Hyperspace Mountain had been bought by Star Wars and its opening tune as we rode into pitch black was exciting and familiar. The ride was probably the best one and we went on it 3 times, but the lighting wasnt perhaps too bright and we could see some of the roller coaster's structure, which sort of ruined the  space illusion , unlike the one in Paris. Grizzly Gulch, an outdoor coaster, was also graced by our bums 3 times as well. To be fair, there was nothing wrong with the ride (it even had a surprise factor) however we were used to the likes of alton towers and our experienced and wise selves craved a higher thrill factor.

This will be comfortable itinerary to exlpore the park at leisure, without rushing through the attractions2. Plan overnight stay at one of the 3 Disney hotels near the Park, since the park is an hour to 90 minutes away from central island or Kowloon and it can be tiring journey back in the night3. Take a 2 day pass at discounted rates4. Not too many vegetarian options in the park. Carry your own supplies if you canFirst and foremost, there are 2 parades in the park , one at 1:30 pm and the other at 7:30 pm followed by night firework display. Both are not to be missed! Try to reach the central parade venue 30 minutes before parade timings to get a vanatge view.The enitre park is divided into 7 zones as follows:a) Toy story Land   rides for adults and kids. Parachute Drop and RC racer are more exciting than the othersb) Mystic Point   Mystic Manor is nice journey in an old Manor on a electro magnetic cartc) Grizzly Gulch   Mine Train is exciting and Geyser Gulch in uniqued) Adventureland   Don't miss the absolutely amazing Lion King Show and kid friendly Jungle River Cruise. Kids will enjoy Tarzan's Treehousee) Fantasyland   Has some wonderful shows which the entire family can enjoy.  It's a small World ,  Mickey Philarmagic ,  Mickey and the Wonderous Book ,  Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh  are simply wonderfulf) Tomorrowland   Futuristic Rides, especially for older kids and adults.  Hyperspace Mountain  is one of the best rides not to be missed. Also try  Orbitron  and  Buzz Year Astroblasters  for fung) Main USA Street   Nothing much to see except an animation theatre and shopsAbove are based on our experience and not a guide.Enjoy your visit",Disneyland_HongKong
493878486,5,2017-2,China,Our stay and time in the park was great. It admittedly had the  Disney Prices  but what can you expect from the Mouse and his friends? The food was very good in the Hotel and the Park. All of the staff was very helpful and everyone we encountered spoke English. The Little Woman and I are thinking of ditching the kids and heading back this summer.,Disneyland_HongKong
493763234,4,2017-5,India,Although the overall area is not as big as some other disney land parks but I would still recommend to take the 2 day ticket specially if you want to cover all the attractions shows and also take pics with the characters. Would recommend to download the disneyland app so that you are updated on the show timings and the availability of characters in different areas at different times. Ofcourse do not miss the light and fire crackers show at the end of the day. Almost all the restaurants offer atleast 1 meal   menu option in vegetarian. ,Disneyland_HongKong
493718326,5,2016-12,Philippines,"Hong Kong experience will never be complete without visiting Disneyland, especially if it's your first time in HK. The attraction has various rides that caters to all ages although some rides are not for the faint of heart (talk about wasting an hour to sleep due to nausea :( ) Nevertheless, Disneyland evoked a lot of happy memories of my childhood. Be sure not to miss the fireworks before the park closes. It's a must see!!! The fireworks show is enough to make all spectators go  wooooooow  in unison!It would be best to visit in the morning so you will have the entire day to explore the attractions. Just make sure you bring your own ponchos (raincoat) just in case it rains. I tell you, the park sells it at a ridiculous price. About the food, it is also pricey. I recommend you allot at least HKD120 to be on the safe side.",Disneyland_HongKong
493499894,4,2017-6,South Korea,"We have an 8 year old who would find a lot of the rides a bit boring. We focused on the rides with  big drops  (see HK DLand website)    Grizzly, Hyperspace, RC Racer, and Iron Man    and they were all fun rides. We rode the Grizzly 5 times, as the wait was less than 5 minutes (lucky considering it was a Sunday afternoon?). We also rode the Toy Soldier Parachute drop, which was fun, but way too short (less than 60 seconds) considering the long wait (25 minutes). There are 2 parades everyday    one at 3pm and one at 7:30pm. They are different, and both are fun to watch.Two things I would recommend everyone do. One, get the HK Disneyland app on your smartphone. It shows the wait time on each ride, so it helps planning on which ride to go to next. Two, eat before or after your visit, and bring a big bottle of water. I did not think the food was that great, and things are pricey inside the park.",Disneyland_HongKong
493448221,3,2017-5,United Kingdom,"I have no doubt it would have been great if we had weather hadnt been so bad. Everything was rained off including the parades. Dont waste your time or money if the weather is bad.Also, the place isnt that big so do not go at 9am because there wont be enough to do until the shows at 8pm. Would recommend going around 2pm.",Disneyland_HongKong

The second time around I was with my husband in 2016, and that time we went inside Disneyland. We were both in awe. Its truly magical. We were like living in our childhood dreams. It was my husband's birthday, and good timing the 10th anniversary of Disneyland Hongkong. I would never forget the fun we had, and the happiness we shared. And most especially the look in my husband's face when he witness the fireworks. His captivated and almost in tears. He said coming to Disneyland was the best birthday he ever had and still is.",Disneyland_HongKong
493175519,5,2017-6,Philippines,"As expected, disney has full of excitement but during our visit, it was very hot. I would suggest that if you intend to visit during month of June, bring at least 2 extra shirts, fan, towel and lots of bottled water. The resto inside is very expensive, better eat in their messhall, more choices of food and 20% cheaper than in a specialty resto. After lunch visit till closing is the best time to go there.",Disneyland_HongKong

493147146,2,2016-11,Italy,"In Hong Kong the whole park revolves around disney merchandising.You'll find an endless serie of similar shops selling all sort of toys and (mostly useless) gimmicks.The rollercoasters seem to target far younger crowds than else in the world, or better, they are family focused, with exhausted adults wearing disney outfits enduring infinite lines with children on tail. Even if I have nothing against it, I was expecting some more excitement for millennials and grown up kids, like you can find in Tokyo for example.Surely a missed opportunity.",Disneyland_HongKong
493022818,5,2017-6,India,"One of the most beautiful experiences of Hong Kong visit, Disneyland is a must visit. It should not be missed as it has something for everyone. A good idea is to take the train ride of the park first as it gives an overall perspective of the park.Comfy shoes are a must. Also do carry water bottles as the ones sold in the park are very expensive. Take five minutes to plan your visit around the park with the help of the map. (You could visit the website and check out the rides and the areas that thrill you the most)It may be the a smaller Disneyland when compared to Florida, but the positive is you can finish it completely in one day.",Disneyland_HongKong
492895842,4,2017-5,Philippines,My 2nd time in Disney HK. The new attraction Iron Man Experience fell short of my expectations. I don't know but the ride not excite me enough. There were not a lot of people when we went so lines are shorter. We watched 2 parades the one around lunch and the one in the afternoon. Both parades are short now. I think I remember the parades before were longer. We did not stay for the fireworks and evening parade. There were not a lot of character sightings also for picture taking. The only character we were able to take pictures with are BB8 and Chewbacca. We did not see the other characters. I still love Disney despite all this. Just wish that they could make the characters come out more for picture taking since there are a lot of Disney characters anyway so they can just rotate. I would have loved to meet the characters again. ,Disneyland_HongKong
492884905,5,2017-6,Australia,"Of course we enjoyed Disneyland. You don't have to be a kid! From the themed train ride from the MTR at Sunny Bay ( a must) and the grand entrance of wide streets, gardens fountain etc, to the park itself, it's just a fun day. It is more kid orientated, a much smaller park than most, less adult roller coaster rides, but who doesn't like going to Disneyland. It's a small world ride still a lovely entertaining experience, though it takes hours to get the song out of your head. As usual always spotlessly clean! Only time we saw the real Disney characters were in the main entrance area, think maybe more Mickey Minnie etc appearances could be made. Tip, avoid the weekend if possible. And be aware, u line up for the Disney train in the park, but they only let u go one stop. We expected to be able to do a circuit, after waiting so long. But came away with ears with our name on it..... so we happy! ",Disneyland_HongKong
492687726,5,2017-1,Thailand,We've stayed in Disneyland Hong Kong Resort therefore it's very near to this park. The area is smaller from the park in other countries but very convenient and suitable for a day trip which you don't need to spend a lot of time for walking between each theme stations. We've stayed for the whole day until evening.,Disneyland_HongKong
492677869,5,2017-6,Philippines,"Truly the happiest place on earth! Best time to arrive during the opening hours to be able to breeze through queues on attractions and rides.

492608247,5,2017-5,Australia,We made a last minute decision to visit HK Disneyland and am very glad we did. It's much smaller than Disneyland and Disney World but absolutely beautiful in its own way. Mystic Manor is their newest attraction along with Iron Man and they are a must do. We enjoyed about 5 1 2 hours here and would recommend it.,Disneyland_HongKong
492600104,5,2017-6,Singapore,The standard by Disneyland never fade. I was there 10 years ago and the quality of service and places still remains as good as new. A must go theme park in hongkong.,Disneyland_HongKong
492341207,5,2017-6,United Arab Emirates,One check off my bucket list.  Hong kong Disneyland brings us to a different world.  It is family friendly but be ready to walk long distances.   Best attractions for me is starwars and mystic manor.,Disneyland_HongKong
492334787,5,2017-6,Philippines,"Absolutely wonderful experience at Disney Land in Hong Kong. My one piece of advice is drink lots of water and bring a change of clothes for the kids and yourself because it's quite a journey to get to Disney Land and it's humid so you go from sweating and wet to aircon in the taxi, bus or train... Enjoy xx ",Disneyland_HongKong
492205229,4,2017-5,Singapore,"We are a group of 5, 3 adults and 2 kids. Stayed at Kingdom Club. Wonderful service by staff in most places in its Hotel and Park. Dining with Characters was an organised one as the staff made sure Mickey, Minne, Pluto and Goofy visited every table. Well done for this. Kingdom Club was good for those with high budget, for 3 days 2 nights was about SGD4000. Room wise, except for 30 over bed bites on my legs and my sister's legs in Disneyland hotel bed near to the curtain, overall furnishings were quite old. Facilities were alright since most of the time, we were at the Park. We made two leisure walks from Disneyland back to hotel, time was about 15mins, we liked it and would do that again. Park experience, overall good except a few grumbling young ladies who were selling the ice cream and popcorns etc mobile booth outside TomorrowLand, probably due to hot weather. They shouted at the customers to queue up when there was no queue line in sight unlike other mobile booths. Waits for rides were about 45mins to 80mins. We had fast pass so not too bad for us. ",Disneyland_HongKong
492171924,4,2017-6,Guam,June is HOT HOT HOT so dress for the heat and humidity. Be sure to take lots of sunscreen and a hat. Toy Story has no shade so take the little ones there early otherwise it's just too hot in the summer! The park is well laid out and most of the staff speak English. The light parade and fireworks are great so be sure to stay and enjoy them. We spent 10 hours there and only saw 4 characters which was very disappointing. ,Disneyland_HongKong
492170334,5,2017-6,United States,"According to 2 hour's research, Klook is as cheap as tickets get. Used Klook for meal passes too, which was a bargain (but one meal for 6 was STILL US$80!! And the food at Tomorrowland was the worst we've had anywhere in Southeast Asia). But, we had fun and blowing some US$450 in a day did fulfill the kids' wishes. They really did enjoy it, and so did we. Disney really should keep all attractions open till closing; it's very frustrating (and rip offy) to close some things a couple hours early. Iron Man was the best attraction, though Hyperspace Mountain was a kick. What most surprised me was what I didn't see: no one was going potty in the water fountain, no one was blowing smoke in kids' faces, no one was pushing or shoving, despite the many TripAdvisor reviews describing such atrocities. To the contrary, people were calm and considerate! Maybe it was because we went on a weekday.",Disneyland_HongKong

492084456,2,2017-5,India,This is surely an over hyped place. The area is very small if you compare with other places. Rides are very few (especially for those who are  12 years) and place is more of a selling Disney merchandise than a theme park. Strictly for kids who are small and are still fascinated by watching cartoon characters. ,Disneyland_HongKong

The whole park's buildings and events are good and nice. The fireworks everynight is amazing.",Disneyland_HongKong
491962350,5,2017-6,India,"This place is vast....the emphasis being on vast. It's divided into various sections. You can easily take the information map near the entrance counter and proceed accordingly. It is very well laid out and the rides and shows a great fun. However, it is extremely expensive and a water bottle costs somewhere between 25   30 HKD .You can easily eat an Indian combo meal at the Explorers club restaurant . Disneyland is well maintained and a must visit for the families. The night time parade is an absolute treat to watch .We got a chance to view the afternoon parade too. This too was great fun. If you are a thrill seeker do not miss hyperspace mountain ride. All in all a great family destination.",Disneyland_HongKong

491369625,5,2017-5,Australia,This was our main reason for the trip as it was cheaper to go there than back to America. Disneyland HK is smaller than the usa one but we had a great time there.

The wait for the rides in June was short as there weren't very much visitors. BUT the heat can easily cause sun burn. There isn't very much cooling places to escape from, not very much seating for the elderly. You MUST look out for water coolers to refill your bottles. Other than that, it was a great experience.",Disneyland_HongKong

Disney is just about perfect and they have thought of everything to ensure your visit is memorable and fun. The rides were all great, the staff were friendly and accomodating. Also if you ask the staff, a lot of them carry stickers for the kids and this became a fun game in itself. We ended up with so many different stickers. It is is course not cheap but it was well worth the expense.",Disneyland_HongKong
491144000,5,2016-12,China,"We   ve been to Disneyland in Anaheim, Orlando, Shanghai and now Hong Kong. Hong Kong Disney is the smallest Disney but it was still magical and far superior to the Disney in Shanghai. We went during the weekday and I   m not kidding, the wait times were absolutely the shortest in any park. I   m not saying it would be like that on the weekend nor would I even want to try but for our visit the lines were amazingly short; 5 10 minute line for each ride. That allowed us to relax and enjoy the park. The staff was amazing and unfriendly, unlike the grouches over in Shanghai. The shows were excellent and lively. It was truly an amazing experience.

Iron Man ride was good (but Transformers @ Universal Studio was way much better). Staffs were friendly. Fireworks at the end is a must see. Not enough feature of Elsa & Anna despite Frozen being one of the more successful animation in recent times. Variety of Disney characters rather limited. Maybe due to the summer heat wave. Plan ahead to tackle certain rides shows (instead of follow the flow of theme attractions) you can always go back to the one you missed towards evening.,Disneyland_HongKong

And of course, you can get your HK Disneyland Exclusive Pandora and Disneyland Parks Exclusive Pandora! There are 2 parades; one in the day and the other at night. The night parade is really creative. After the night parade, don't leave so soon as there will be fireworks at the Sleeping Beauty Castle.

490002960,5,2017-6,Singapore,"It's one of the best attractions of Hong Kong that requires you to spend at least the entire day there. The experience begins as soon as you reach Sunny Bay MTR. The train to Disneyland is fitted with everything iconic about Disney, including the windows!The entire theme park is super clean and it opens as early at 10am as a preview. The rides cater to both adults and children. Spend time and explore. The new ride for Ironman is superb, though the StarWars attraction was a little under developed for such a rich franchise. One thing to note for adults is the lack of coffee throughout the theme park. Lunchtime crowds can be very challenging on your patience. End your day at the souvenir shops and not at the beginning. Else you will have to lug all your gifts on gravity defying rides. Stay for the parade that starts at 8pm and only leave after the nightly fireworks. It's worth it all! Enjoy!",Disneyland_HongKong

We manage to ride almost everything that day compare when we first came here. We decided to go mid week to avoid congestion of tourist and that was a good decision.

489947340,4,2017-1,Finland,"Disneyland is cute and exiting for kids with it's theme which is visible anywhere you look, but the only thing is that their height limits are kinda high compared to Universal studios in Singapore for example. Our 3 year old daughter who loves fast rollercoasters, didn't get to go on a single one, because she was 104 cm when the minimum height was more to some attractions. But she only complained for a minute and enjoyed every second in the other attractions for smaller kids, since they were so good and beautiful made. We saw a 30 minute musical about Lion king which was wonderful, and just a perfect little time for a 3 year old to hang on to. In the evening when Disneyland closed, a firework began behind the Disney castle. I was very impressed myself even if I'm 28 years old. That was definitely everything but a fiasco. The disney stores in the theme park are very crowded before closing so make sure you buy your souvenirs during the day time to avoid long lines. We went to Ocean park too. If you can't deside eather you should go to disneyland or ocean park, we definitely recommend disneyland. It's better, even for adults and I'm not a huge disney fan or anything.

There are many common rides like it's a small world and the Winnie the Pooh ride however, there are some rides such as Mystic Manor and the Iron Man experience that are only in HK!The park is also possibly one of the cheaper ones of the world, the ticket itself is around   60 and you can get meals for about   10. Parking is around   20 for the day.Do stay for the fireworks as they are lovely! ",Disneyland_HongKong
488660676,4,2017-5,Canada,"I didn't actually know there was a Disneyland in HK until we got there. I have been to the Disney in Orlando and California, and while there obviously there are way more attractions in Orlando, I would compare this park to the one in California. Prices are comparable to the other Disney parks. I went in May and was surprised to see the lines to get on rides were less than 20 minutes to get on. We did not wait longer than that for every ride, so we were able to go on all the large rides in a morning! (We are in our 30s, so did not go on the kids rides, however would have had time if we wanted to.) Over all fun visit   if you are looking to do something fun in HK! ",Disneyland_HongKong
488627373,4,2017-5,India,"The entrance and facilities , crowd control , ticket facility, commuting is well planned and appreciable. Inside the park the sections and it's details for all categories of ages are well planned and well maintained.  The parade and fireworks is a world class feature worth going for again n again. Kids will enjoy and thank their parents for the visit.  The food stalls and it's contents should be planned for all types of crowd as people around the world visit this park to enjoy.All types of cusines can be included in menu as far as possible.  Soveniour stalls are appreciable. Overall a classic place . Visit worth remembering for a lifetime.",Disneyland_HongKong
488612724,4,2017-5,United Kingdom,"I was interested to see how Hong Kong Disneyland compared with the parks in Orlando and Paris. I wasn't disappointed. I visited on a Thursday as having read many reviews I wanted to avoid the weekend when more local guests visit. I also opted for a Disney Dining package to cut down on costs. Travelled to the park using MTR from Hong Kong via Sunny Bay. Ordered tickets online and picked up at  Magic  collection booths to avoid queues. First off it's small, compared to WDW in Orlando it's tiny and even compared to Paris it's small. That said everything is really accessible, you can criss cross the park easily and I would say 1 day is more than enough to take in the major attractions and shows. If you do have small ones then maybe 2 days would be needed as it can get hot and the queues tend to be for the Fantasy land rides of which only the Winnie the Pooh ride has FastPass.Whilst I was there many of the food outlets were closed so I was restricted using my food vouchers, however there were 4 5 places I could use them. The food options are varied with both Western and Oriental options. Prices vary from HK$95 for a burger combo to HK$159 for a mixed grill combo. There are side dishes available too for uner HK$50.Main Street was crowded at the 10:30am rope drop as the Main Street is smaller than other parks but guests dispersed quickly and after heading straight to Tomorrowland there were no queues for Hyperspace Mountain   I rode 3 times without having to queue.Some areas open and close at different times   Grizzly Gulch opened at 11 and closed at 19:45   I'm assuming for  crowd  management and maintenance. Throughout the day I was able to re ride a few times on the main roller coasters without queueing   longest wait was 15 minutes on Runaway Mine Cars due to a hardware glitch.Many of the rides are similar to the US and Paris versions but with subtle differences. Space Mountain is tamer than Paris but racier than Orlando   no inversionsRunaway Mine Cars   has cool reverse section like Everest in Animal KingdomMystic Manor   Haunted Mansion 2.0  serious upgrade.Ironman Experience   Star Tours rebrand.Only 3 FastPass rides Hyperspace Mountain, IronMan experience and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh   nothing over in Grizzly Gulch or Toy Story Land.Lots of rides have indoor sections so you aren't outside in the heat and humidity all day.Park was kept clean and tidy with no obvious signs of litter.All in all a great value day out.",Disneyland_HongKong

The Jungle cruise is different from the Florida park and Its a Small World is longer. No Tom Sawyer island and no Liberty Square. The parade is very good. There are many Asian dishes on restaurant menus. It is easy to get to on the direct Disneyland MTR line. I thought the entrance price should be $10 $15 lower than it was. ,Disneyland_HongKong
488347300,4,2017-5,Australia,"A piece of Americana in Asia.

Don't miss out the parade bec it is where all the characters go out and dance. Upon entrance at the park, make sure that you'll get a guide map so you'll know what  world  you want to explore. It is also where you will see the schedule of shows. For those who doesnt understand Chinese, fall in line on the attractions with English guides. The fireworks are to die for, I dont know but it gives us goosebumps...maybe bec it brings out childhood memories in us.

Not so much for safely but to make sure no food or drink brought in. Lines on a thur. Not bad. Some attractions where closed though, kind a disappointment.

Whilst a two or sometimes three day visit to L.A or other parks, a day would complete Hong Kong D.L.The rides are average , but o.k and still scary for the newcomer. Though in truth all Disneylands have all the youngsters happily contentented, so dont let these words put you off. Still well worth a day's visit.",Disneyland_HongKong

There is fasty pass access concept..which you can avail on each ticket at a gap of 2 hours. Wherever on a ride you have this access available...scan your ticket on fast pass access and come back on the designated ride. at 8:30 in the evening there is a huge fireworks show...do not miss it at any cost. It's a lifetime experience. Wear comfortable shoes to Disneyland..you will be walking a lot. Make sure you carry some extra water bottles with you..since each 750 ml bottle inside the park costs 28 hong kong dollars. Enjoy the fantasy land rides..and bring out the child in you.

The roller coaster is not so scary but it's exciting. We also had lunch in the park. It's not cheap but relatively reasonable. It costs you HK$120 150 for a lunch with soft drinks. The food's not bad and we enjoyed sitting outdoor where we found very comfortable.Recommend to spend two days on weekdays. After that, you can go to nearby Tung Chung MTR station for shopping and dining. If time allowed, go to take the cable car in Tung Chung as well. The view is fantastic and there's a small interesting town in the terminus where it's worth to pay a visit.",Disneyland_HongKong

486962412,5,2017-5,Singapore,"Possibly one of the smallest Disneyland which you can complete all rides and shows in a day but what keeps the thrill and customers to return is the efforts to keeping afresh of new rides and experience, ie Ironman Expo, themes and decorations ie spring & Easter.

I spent the whole day in the Disneyland. We download a disneyland apps to check all the schedule of shows and waiting time for shows & amusement park and also disney character photo session. It's really convenient. We missed out many photo session due to shows and the amusement park which is a little disappointing.Always check out the time for afternoon parade and night parade in order to secure a good spot to watch, otherwise you may end up nowhere and unable to view the most iconic scenery, shows and parade.",Disneyland_HongKong

My first time to ride so many rides in this park compare to Tokyo with waiting time like 1.5 hours for popular ones.. Our day ended with the Parade. It was a very good one indeed..

486709625,4,2017-4,Philippines,"No matter how old or young you are, Disneyland is a place to be. Hongkong Disneyland is far from the city, but transportation is not a problem. They have their own Disney train, complete with Mickey Mouse windows, that you can ride from Sunny Bay station going to Disneyland. If you are staying in HongKong central or Tsim Sha Tsui, it is a one hour ride and you have transfer trains. Before you enter the main gate to Disneyland Theme Park, there is a luggage storage area at the side so you could leave your things though I'm not sure if it's free. You can also but food for a much cheaper price outside, and of course, eat it there before going in. We availed our ticket from the host of our hostel and got it for a cheaper price and we were able to skip the long ticketing lines.Once you got in, you may get the map and attraction schedules on the side. This will help you decide where to go first and what time are the shows and parades. We went there on a Friday so the line wasn't long. Toy Story attractions are more about rides and I suggest you visit that place first. There are restaurants inside Disneyland and they are expensive. About HK$130 for a full meal. But we got a discount coupon from the airport (Go to the tourism board booth) and we got 20% off on the meal we bought. The servings were big and good enough for 2 so you can share. The best place to watch the parade is on Main Street USA, beside the cafe. Check the schedule of the parade. When we went there last April, we watched the production of Lion King and it was really great. Don't miss out on watching these shows. Staff inside Disneyland give out stickers for free. If they don't give you one, you can ask them. The stickers are good souvenir and it's free! You can also ask them to take your pictures. Walking around Disneyland is tiring so don't forget to bring water and wear comfy shoes. For those who are wondering, it's HK$50 for a mickey mouse or ironman waffle. The ice cream is for HK$30.Don't forget to watch the fireworks display!",Disneyland_HongKong

486699175,5,2017-5,Thailand,"I'm a lifelong Disney fan and I loved this park. There were cool differences from California and Florida   both in the smaller size and in some of the Asian sensibilities: a really cool Mystic Manor replaced the Haunted Mansion (loved it), a Toy Story land is a heaven of huge toys (and a deceptively fun Hot Wheels roller coaster), and the Star Wars upgrade to Space Mountain ROCKED. Otherwise, you may see more gardens, eat some squid, miss Pirates of the Caribbean, and see more precision in the Asian section of Small World. And don't forget to take the subway here   the last train with its Mickey windows will get you in the mood. ",Disneyland_HongKong

485814929,5,2017-5,India,"Sharing some tips for a family visit 1) If you are visiting Disneyland for the first time, better is to buy two days tickets as weather can change anytime. So if you have two days tickets you can use the second day ticket in case it rains   you face long queue. 2) Try buying tickets from deals site, do a google search 3) For senior citizen tickets buy directly from Disneyland site. 4)No food is allowed inside, and whatever is available inside is expensive  may not be to your test. But you can make sure to reach early around 9.30. Carry some dry food , have it in nice sitting area before micky water fountain. 5) They have meal deal which needs to be purchased before entry. Buy this only if you are ready to order the most expensive meal option ( mostly with beaf) to get true discount. If you are a veg person you are better buying an individual items than meal coupon.",Disneyland_HongKong

Although he only went on a few rides because he's an impatient little boy, he still had loads of fun running around the place. Food is quite expensive, since, my wife, son and I were really hungry we probably spent over HKD600 for lunch and snacks. But still we got to take home a really nice Mickey Mouse shaped lunchbox. All in all, we had a great time there. Everything is convenient. We brought our on stroller, but the place has strollers and wheelchairs for rent. Walking is a breeze.

It was also a lot quitter at night and we had several goes on many of the rides that had long queues during the day.

We stayed till the fireworks, which is something you just have to see when you're at Disneyland. I'd recommend to look at the fireworks from the shopping street as you can leave immediately afterwards and you're not caught in the mass of people.I think it's nice the trains are personalised to Disney figures. Good connection as there's a special Disneyland stop. I enjoy they really try to suck you in the magical atmosphere they have. As expected the food is quite expensive here, so we didn't eat here.

After being to Paris and Disney World, this was a breath of fresh air (sometimes a little bit hot air) This park is set in the most beautiful back drop. It is like they have taken a chuck of a mountain out and placed a Beautiful Disney park. The castle from a distance with the green Valleys in the back ground and it not being the busiest of parks is is picture perfect. It Has a very cool chilled vibe to this park, never a rush to get everywhere just a nice little walk through green plants, trees and water mist spots.My two girls (6 &4 Years old) were able to get most of the rides apart from two but while my 6year old and her dad went on the Grizzle bear , me and the youngest played next to the blowholes that got you wet (good way to cool down if it's hot) the food in the park was delicious I don't think we had a bad meal. I didn't feel that it was so expensive for the food or the merchandise. We didn't get to meet the princesses due to the face we kept missing them but we get get a little wave from Tinkerbell, which made the girls happy. The shows are wonderful and a must.. the best rides for us was the Grizzle bear mine train and the Mystic manor. ",Disneyland_HongKong

There was almost no line at all the rides which made it a lot more fun than other Disney parks. We paid about $100 CAD per ticket which is also cheaper than the other parks.

And whenever we have friends coming with their kids we always love to meet there and we love our Instagram meetUp with HK followers or even overseas one, it's Truly magical. They do a good job of outlining where and at what time the characters will be out greeting. Characters commonly sign autograph books, which you can buy in the Emporium on Main Street. It is a nice souvenir for your kids to have. They can put the stickers staff around the park will give them in this book, too.",Disneyland_HongKong

The small world boat ride is very cute and enjoyable. The place isn't too big so we were able to see all the sections. The food is just expensive but all in all we had fun. Some staff are rude too but we just ignored them because we didn't want to ruin our day. The parades and fireworks are the highlights of our day! ,Disneyland_HongKong

Throughout our visit, NOT A SINGLE cast member wished me a Happy Birthday (I was quite hurt). The cast members all looked like they've been owed their wages and did not look like they were working at the most magical place on earth. It wasn't even a particularly busy day because it had rained in the morning, so we could only go in at almost noon ish. The only up side was the queues were relatively short, but that's about it. Don't think it's worth spending close to a $100 (SGD) here. Will probably be my last visit. I'd rather save more money and go to Tokyo Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong

483315613,4,2017-5,Singapore,"Maybe due to the opening of Shanghai Disneyland, the queue wasn't as long as before. Formerly we have to wait for 45 min for a kiddish ride, like Pooh Bear. Now, even for the latest ride   like Iron Man, the wait at the queue is about 15 min. The cut in the waiting time and good weather definitely contribute to the enjoyable experience in Disneyland.

If you have young kid or kid by hear I am sure you are otherwise you won't be visiting Disney. I recommend to take priority pass and one night stay at one of hotels inside the park. By this way you will avoid travel time and queue, normal ticket queue time can go anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes. If its weekend it's double time. Park don't allow any food or drinks from outside. Food chart inside park only accept cash you need to carry sufficient cash to buy water bottle, Micky ice cream, soft drinks and waffle. Food court, restaurant and souvenir shops accepts Cards.

482495488,4,2017-5,United States,"Have visited Disney parks in California and Florida, and recently had the opportunity to visit their park in Hong Kong. Getting here was very easy. The MTR provides Disney park with its own line. You can get to the park from pretty much anywhere the MTR services Hong Kong. We made our visit on a Tuesday ( May 2nd). Arrived there just minutes before the park opened (10:30am). Pleasantly surprised with the small crowd. The park entrance is very wide and clean. Landscaping is traditional Disney. As you pass the entrance (the main train station ) and walk into  Main Street, USA  you will understand why I chose the title   it's a small world after all . Had I done some research prior to coming I would have not been surprised by how small this park really is. It's nearly one fifth the size of Magic Kingdom in Florida. Aside from the small scale , the park is very much  Disney . Tarzan's tree house was closed for maintenance. This has a big impact considering the few attractions in the park. For the roller coaster enthusiasts , I recommend the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. I won't give it away just suffice it to say there are surprising maneuvers. Over all a fun park despite its small size ( you can easily cover the entire park at a leisurely walk in less than 5 hrs, just my opinion). Expect hefty prices for any and all goods you purchase in the park. Most park employees speak English enough to communicate with you. We were pleased to find most employees had left the Honk Kong attitude at the gate. Get a bench early (6 6:30pm) in front of the castle for a good view of the fireworks. Park closes promptly after the pyrotechnics (8:00pm). There are plenty of trains to take you back to your destination so no need to worry. Overall a pleasant experience , but the size of the park was disappointing. ",Disneyland_HongKong
482317447,4,2017-5,Canada,"Smaller than Anaheim park and is like a minipark compared to Orlando. Easy to navigate and shorter distance between attractions. They have multiple languages to suit the needs of the customers. There are rides that are different than the US parks. Expensive because the entrance fee is just slightly lower than the US park. However, you go on more rides as the line ups are shorter. Very easy to get there as the MTR goes to the front entrance.",Disneyland_HongKong

Everything is really well done and the technology in there makes the place enchanted. It honestly makes you feel like you're in a fairytale. It's a big day tho if you want to see everything, so either get plenty of sleep before you get there or get the 2 day pass. I would imagine family would need even more time. The place is very well designed for crows and pumps it through. Absolute must do in Hong Kong",Disneyland_HongKong

Not too crowded and less walking, and half the price!",Disneyland_HongKong
482127757,4,2017-4,United States,"This park is definitely smaller than the parks in the United States, but still lots of fun. Loved the Mystic Manor ride and Buzz Lightyear shooting ride.

482020640,5,2017-4,Australia,Our family were given tickets for Disneyland and weren't sure how long to spend there. We ended up being the first ones through the gate and the last ones out. But not because the queues were long   there was just that much to do. Download the app and see the waiting times. We averaged about 15 minutes waiting time per ride. The parades are spectacular. They have all the old favourites plus a few new cool rides. Hyper space mountain was our family favourite. And don't miss the Lion King show   it is basically a mini version of the stage show. The only small complaint is that not many of the food outlets were open and those that were open had poor quality options.,Disneyland_HongKong

481749681,4,2017-5,Australia,"Very glad we purchased two day tickets as it was crazy busy (due to being holidays in China and lots of people visiting HK). Heat was incredible on Wednesday   saw two different people require medical attention due to queuing in the sun. Waited to see Mickey for nearly an hour and gave up as there were still at least 50 people in front of us (even though we were told it would take one hour when we joined the queue, that was also in full sun). The queues for photos with the characters were full of adults and no consideration was given at all to families with kids. I know everyone pays to get in, but does every adult really need a professional photo with Mickey and Minnie and then take another 10  posed photos with their own camera?!?!?! Time limits need to be set, ie each  group  (and not each individual) has xx time with the characters so the queue actually moves.Got the MTR to Disneyland from Kowloon   easy but busy.Food choices available and prices ok (paid about AU$60 for four people at the Tomorrowland dinner   burgers etc). Still can't believe I paid HK$32 for an iceblock but it was so incredibly hot there was really no choice.Kids had a ball, which was the main reason we attended.",Disneyland_HongKong
481727960,5,2017-5,Thailand,We had an amazing time with my family . So much to do. I think I would recommend that you buy the tickets via the hotel you're staying it seem to be a little cheaper and also we when we booked on Line the transaction couldn't be completed when we clicked on confirm the page popped up saying  oops your page got eaten up.  we didn't get any tickets but money was deducted from our account. We had to buy new tickets again in Disneyland but the bank reimbursed the money about 2 weeks later. So just to save yourself from this headache just buy the tickets at the hotel you're staying. Ah Shan hostel was selling for cheaper price than what we paid on Line . It's a great place for parents too. Not just for kids. Lol.,Disneyland_HongKong

I've never been a huge Disney fan but I would highly recommend it. ,Disneyland_HongKong
481537192,5,2017-4,United Kingdom,Me and my partner and our friend from Shanghai had the best time ever at Disneyland Hong Kong. We was there from the opening to the closing of the park its such a great place. I have been to Anaheim Disney and all the parks in Florida but this park has something special about it. it has all the Disney magic you need. The park has some great rides like Hyperspace Mountain to the amazing Grizzly Gulch Ride. We loved watching all the parades especially the flights of fantasy parade to the amazing paint the night parade now that is something you really have to see! Its one of the most amazing night time Disney parades i have seen. There was a bit of a queue to meet the characters but its like that in every park. I have to say that the food here is incredible! All the cast members were so friendly too! We all loved every second of our day at Disneyland Hong Kong and i cant wait to go back! Its also very easy to get to from the City of Hong Kong by the MTR.,Disneyland_HongKong
481507910,4,2017-4,Singapore,"Spent a full day at Hong Kong Disney and the whole themed park is well designed with lot of rides for children and adults.Customers can use their tickets for the fast lane at selected rides like the iron man and Winnie the Pooh ride. My favourite rides would be the star wars and the hot wheel rides which are fun.You can easily find food and drink stalls within the themed park, including bathroom.They also have luggage storage facility for tourists (located before the Disney entrance) and stroller rental in the premise.Do stay till the evening to watch the fireworks. Overall, it was a fun experience especially for guests who grew up watching Disney cartoons.Tips: drink lots of water, wear a hat and apply sunblock.",Disneyland_HongKong
481507082,4,2017-4,Philippines,"I remember first going to HK Disney and thinking it was quite small, now they have two new areas open (and a third coming soon) which has improved it no end, but it still feels small compared to the other Disney Parks around the world. Regardless of that, it is a lovely afternoon to spend with the family and if you go on the right day then you are not going to be queuing any more than 15 minutes for the rides. The parade and fireworks in the evening are also great.",Disneyland_HongKong
481452583,5,2017-5,Philippines,The park is clean. Upgrade to magic access if you are planning to visit the park more than 2 days. Lots of discounts to offer! The Spring Parade & Paint the Night Parade was gorgeous. We'll definitely come back.     ,Disneyland_HongKong

The wait for the rides was not long at all. Our average wait was 20 minutes. The staff there was nice. I have to say that the food at the park is very expensive.

481189227,5,2017-5,United States,"I'm a Disney kid who grew up into an adult who still loves escaping into fantasy and have visited most disney parks around the world. Disney HK is worth the trip. Mystic Manor is Imagineering in top form. The park layout makes it easy to enjoy in less than a day but I'm sure you could spend longer. Shuttle service to the Disney hotels made everything really convenient. Unfortunately I had a bad experience on opening day of the new Explorers Lodge but I trust Disney will fix issues  I just felt harrased and as if the magic of a Disneyland was stolen from me. Either way, Disneyland HK was super fun  I recommend checking out some of the products you can only get in the gift shops  I picked up an awesome Star Wars limited edition collectible and was just really caught up in the Disney magic until I left and went back to the lodge. Definitely go to Disney HK. My friends had just gone and also recommended downloading the app to help navigate and get useful tips. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Most of the rides are indoors so this did not have much of an impact. But there are a few outside which seem to keep going in the rain. I decided to brave the rain for a few of them and ended up a bit wet, but went to watch Lion King afterwards & dried out a little. The show was fantastic & has us singing Hakuna Matata. Unfortunately the rain did not stop in time for the night time parade & sadly it was cancelled. It did stop for the fireworks & this made our day. The park is a bit on a the expensive side and some of the attractions were closed due to maintenance. Other than that there was little to complain about.",Disneyland_HongKong
481108330,5,2017-5,South Africa,"My wife and I visited Disney World Hong Kong for a day. We were unsure of what to expect since we got mixed reviews from Trip Advisor and people who have visited before.We have not been to any other Disney World before and understand that the Hong Kong park is the smallest one.On arrival, you can feel the excitement of parents who are trying to fulfil their little ones dreams. The kids are in absolute over drive mode from the time they get there.Disney does very well in creating a fun and vibrant atmosphere. This is how all customers are should be treated and proves to be a great customer service lesson for all companies. All the facilities are well kept, neat and clean including the rest rooms. When going on tides the waiting areas are designed to cool guests off mostly in shaded areas through either air conditioning and fans.The queues can be long for some of the popular shows and rides but are all worth the wait. Like I said even for adults the shows, showmanship, costumes, special effects are completely amazing.The not to miss shows include the Iron Man experience (more for adults and teens), Mickey's story book and the Lion King (especially for kids). There are other shows catering more the younger kids (ages 5   11) like mystic manor, pooh bear, etc. We went on all of these nonetheless as it gives you great reprieve from the humidity during the hottest parts of the day.There are a few small scale roller coasters and thrilling rides which we did not do as my wife does not have the stomach for it. For thrill seekers these appear to be good.Food and drinks in the park is quite expensive (HK $ 32 for a 500 ml coke) and there are many restaurants, hot dog stands and ice cream stands for snacks and bites and refreshing drinks.You are allowed to bring small snacks and cold drinks into the park and suggest you do so if you planning a full day there.The night parade at about 19h30 is worth the wait especially for the little ones and teens. We skipped the fireworks display which is on at 20h30 after having spent the whole day there from 11h00 but we have heard that it is quite spectacular.Also suggest that you do the train ride first when you enter the park as it provides perspective on what there is in the park and allows you to plan what to first if you not planning on staying the whole day.You could do the entire park in a full day depending on how may kids you have. If you just adults one day is enough.Enjoy!!!",Disneyland_HongKong
481103955,3,2017-5,Australia,This was a slightly disappointing visit. I expected there to be more rides. As an adult I was after more roller coaster and thrill rides. It catered for mainly you d children. Grounds very tidy and clean. The food was also very good. I probably wouldn't return or see the need for a 2 day pass. Everything is able to be achieved in one day. ,Disneyland_HongKong

The rides are provided to suit the whole family participating which is really nice. Some rides albeit a bit extreme were enjoyed by young and old alike with no tears or tantrums. Some of the rides  amusements were better than Anaheim and these included the mystic mansion, Disney garden and Toy Story rides. Front of the line passes were available for some rides with the younger rides such as Pooh Bear requiring the longest wait. The food and facilities were excellent and grounds pristine. The new Marvel ride and the Disney Musical experience was great with large groups of people accommodated at each session reducing the wait time. Great gift shops and Pandora now provided exclusive Disney options. Western options available in a cute cafe in Main Street with amazing children's meals.

If you stay to the end of the fireworks expect the MTR to be very bust indeed, but they didn't let it get too overcrowded.Some of the attractions were being renovated, but the major hit with our 4 year old was the Ironman Experience which was worth the wait.",Disneyland_HongKong
480763605,5,2016-11,United States,"This is a great Disney park. It's smaller than Disney World and Tokyo Disney, but it is very nice. Christmas was amazing. Everything is decorated as it would be in an early 20th century American small town. The lit the tree with LEDs that changed colors, couples in Victorian costume sang carols (the Christian ones too), and snow fell all along Main Street. The light and fireworks show was outstanding and every bit as good as Orlando. If you're in Hong Kong, you must spend a day and evening at HK Disney. ",Disneyland_HongKong

480596236,4,2017-4,United States,We stayed at one of the hotels at Disneyland and the rooms were very spacious and well appointed. The crowds were very manageable being there in March. Our only complaints were the bar in the hotel was closed and the parachute ride was out of service. The other rides were great and the kids had lots of fun. Our granddaughter and her grandmother(on her 75th birthday) rode the roller coaster.,Disneyland_HongKong

480347937,5,2017-4,Australia,We reached with our 2 yr old daughter at 11am and spent the whole day here until the night parade which is NOT TO BE MISSED! The property has amazing rides and extremely good facilities. I would recommend to head out to the rides that you definetly want to go on and scan your pass to get a 'fast pass' at a certain time. Once you do this for all rides you can plan your day around the place and reach the rides at that time to directly walk in rather than waiting in an hour long queue for a 5min ride. There is a storybook kingdom right at the end of the property which is the best ride for children aged 2 6. Don't miss the Iron Man experience.. it'll blow your mind!,Disneyland_HongKong

Only complaints I have is Mickey and Minnie need to be out way more for photos everyone wants photo with them and there hardly out. Another is common curtesy a certain type of guest have not idea on queuing and covering mouths when they cough and does no selfie sticks mean no selfie sticks, this should be enforced more. Got so feed up people standing in busy walkways to pull out the selfie stick and pose for photos of themselves ",Disneyland_HongKong
480054626,4,2017-4,Switzerland,"We went on a regular Friday around 11am under the cloudy sky. Not many people & we needed max 10 min for a ride if there was a line. Some ride we went 2, 3 times in a row without waiting at all, unbelievable!!!I went to Disney Tokyo & Paris, it's smaller. Good if you have smaller kids. Main languages are Cantonese, English & Mandarin.Now it's not allowed to use the selfie stick in the park & I don't see clear indication at the door. The staff sometime screamed at the microphone for some people who didn't understand & the people were really crazy, ignored them too...Toilets are everywhere & it's very clean with staff often cleaning. Souvenir shops are at all the corners waiting for you to spend money.Baby facilities available. Can leave the pushchair just outside the attraction in a special area, sometimes there is someone keep an eye of the area.Last year I went into Space mountain with my 6 year son then, without knowing how it was exactly, however I've asked if he's allowed to go on & he was tall enough, & we would be sitting next to each other. Anyway, it was so scary that I thought he would fly out of the car anytime. This time the Ironman area was built. We visited the Ironman experience. We took our time to ask questions & got detailed answer. If I'm not wrong, there are 4 (cinema liked) rooms, this means less waiting time. It was a tour visit of HK but with Ironman & monster in between, 3D, air, chair moving experience. Nice atmosphere with everyone was laughing & screaming.The ride is fairly short, a min or 2. Sometime the staff spent so much time to check all the doors were closed & secure than the ride.Moneywise, I found it's quite expensive for the daily extrance fee (1 Adult HKD 589) , as well the food, a simple meal easily cost HKD 100. There is a 2 days' pass which you can use 2 times within 7 days period, that's much more interesting (1 Adult HKD 759)Overall, if you're well prepared, it would be a pretty good experience with your kids.",Disneyland_HongKong

Yes 10 rides is nothing to most people but for us who will que for an hour just to have a few minutes of photo taking with Mickey and Minnie, this is an achievement in itself. If it was winter period where sunset is earlier, will not be able to meet it to 10 rides since a fraction of the riders were done in evening.Noticed considerably lesser China tourists than before.Take the meal and ride combo package which offers good value for lunch but food was nothing to shout about however the portion huge.",Disneyland_HongKong

There were hardly any queues this day despite being Easter Sunday so we delightfully did double rounds on our favourite rides. The price is quite reasonable and worth paying just to see the Lion King show, incredible.

Infact i enjoyed this place as much as my 12 year old daughter. there are theme parks based on various themes and all have spectacular rides and shows.best part is that they are all pre paid and is managed very well. there is a display of expected waiting time at all rides which makes you decide whether u want to wait of not. there are plenty of eating joint all round the place however if you a hardcore indian eater who eats only indian food then the choice is limited and the food is nothing great. cleanliness is superb all around. the show finishes with a parade modeled on the samba theme and is finished by spectacular fire works.

479763629,5,2017-4,Canada,"There are 3 ways to go to Disneyland from Hong Kong International Airport: (1) Disney train direct to Disneyland (2) Airport train ride and a bus ride (3) taxi. We ended up taking a taxi as it worked out cheaper and it took less than 15 minutes to get there. It was fairly early in the morning, around 7am, and Disneyland itself didn   t open until 10:00am, so we went straight to the hotel and had buffet breakfast at the restaurant where some of the Disney characters will come out and interact with the guests and take pictures with you. We also ended up keeping our luggage at their storage for free! They also have free shuttles going to from Disneyland from the two hotels in the area that runs every half hour. If you are going direct to Disneyland, they have lockers for your things onsite too, and it will be cheaper than renting a locker at the airport.It   s not a big one compared to the ones in US and Europe but it   s a fair size that you could spend a whole day there and still have something left to do. Most people take 2 days or so on average to enjoy it to the fullest. There various stores, 2 3 parades in a day, tons of rides, and shows. Since it is in Hong Kong, everything is both in English and Cantonese (I think).Grab the schedule of events shows and the map, which is in a shed on the right side before the entrance. You will need it to plan your day to make sure you catch the different shows and parade times. Also, I cannot rave enough about the Ironman Experience (ride). I wasn   t even really planning to go, but that was a fun surprise! Make sure to try it!This place will make you feel like a kid     it really is a happy place!",Disneyland_HongKong

I went there first time in 2013 and there was no fairy tale garden at that time. This is my third times visiting HK Disneyland and I always feel enchanted with their magical atmosphere. Though this park a way much smaller than any other Disneyland, but they keep it compact and attractive. And since a new Disneyland opened in Shanghai last year, so there was less tourists from Mainland China (which is good for me). I recognize that all staffs can understand at least 3 languages; cantonese, mandarin, and english in quite good. Keep performance well! ",Disneyland_HongKong

Longest queue time was an hour but most rides were 30mins or so during our visit. Rides for young and big kids at heart! Lots of food stations and restaurants dotted around, toilets were clean and plentiful. There wasn't a parade at the end of the day due to the fact it had rained and health & safety because of this. However we stayed for the fireworks and this made up for it, worth staying for. MTR links were quick and direct and not too bad when exiting after the fireworks despite the big crowds.",Disneyland_HongKong

It is not a large park, but large enough when time was limited. I visited on a Saturday and most rides had long lines. It is worth downloading the App as it updates the wait time for rides and was handy in providing general information about the park. Gift shop was extensive in its range. We purchased some mouse ears and they threw in embroidery of the child's name, which was great. Food wasn't bad and they also had gluten free items on the menu which was unexpected. The site including railway station and grounds were well maintained and the Disney train was super cute with the Mouse shaped windows.

479321414,3,2017-4,Denmark,I went there with my family last week. It's a nice place but does not have the feel of Disneyland. Mostly because most of the themes are from newly acquired studios. For example there is quite a big Toy Story area. There is no Pirates of the Caribbean nor Haunted Mansion. The old steam train only has one stop. No Dinosaurs etc. It's a diet version of Disneyland. Can you enjoy yourselves? Sure. Check it out. You're already here.,Disneyland_HongKong

Some of it I got bored. Three times we fell in line and after waiting for sometime they told us there is a technical problem.Can be access by MTR.Regarding food, yes, it is expensive. But, there is a fast food inside near the Marvel area that sells 2pc chicken, 1 rice, 1 drink, and fries for 99hkd. The chicken are relatively big so you can just buy another rice and drink and make the meal for two.They will search your belongings if there are food.Recommended time to use here is opening till fireworks.",Disneyland_HongKong

Highly recommended if you are visiting Hong Kong.",Disneyland_HongKong

It was a little disappointing that the Lion King show was not on as it is a definite highlight of the park. The ground crew are not as  smiley  when compared to the Tokyo parks.

We were lucky to go on a day that was after the Easter public holidays so the queues weren't very long at all (max. 20 min wait), and the queues also moved very fast. Staff can all speak English which is a huge bonus for western tourists. A number of food options available including a traditional Chinese restaurant which I found to be an interesting cultural experience not expected of a Disneyland.

This is the smallest of the parks but don't let that put you off.We visited on a Tuesday in April and were there upon opening to purchase tickets. What surprised us about this park is the reasonably short queuing times. Within 15 minutes of opening, we had done Buzz Lightyear's Blaster TWICE   no queues whatsoever. When you compare this to what remains my favourite Disney park, Tokyo, the queue for this ride in Japan will often be over 90 minutes.We managed to most of the rides with our boys (8 and 3) given small waiting times. My sons enjoyed all the rides; the eight year old especially enjoyed the Star Wars ride.

I would love to have seen the parade but we only had tickets for 1 day and sitting waiting for the parade would have been too boring for kids so rides it was. The castle is tiny (imagine font size 6) but the fireworks were 10x of what you can imagine. Kids on shoulders, not much of a view for us but amazing fireworks. It was a long show, not sure how many minutes but worth the weight of kids in our shoulders. Rides, go for all that you can. Shows, you're gonna miss some. Make sure you don't miss the Lion King. It's a MUST!!! Food, we are at the Royal Banquet Hall. Prices between HKD135 160. Fantasy land gardens I believe thats what it's called. Superb landscape. Take lots of photos.

My family have gone to Disneyland Orlando, CA and that was our bench mark, however KL Disneyland had their charms and still we had a magical experience. As always use fast pass when you can and keep hydrated in the warmer months. Technically we could of done the whole park in one day but wanted to take it easy and our time, the new Iron Man experience was new as was some of the other rides.

Never seen such short queues as we did in HK.It was literally a 5 minute queue for most rides. Sure, it is smaller than other Disney theme parks   but if the kids can go on rides multiple times over with little queueing   surely that is preferable? And it's not especially small, still takes a full day to see it all. Easy to access on the MTR. Took us about 50 minutes and two transfers from Kowloon. Use Google Maps to plot your route.Other reviews mention high expense of food   sure it is pricier than usual, but was not over the top in my opinion. I'm sure the queues are larger on weekends and peak times, but mid week   we had no issues. Well worth it if you have a weekday to kill in Hong Kong. Added tips: the kids can participate in the live action Star Wars show, register as Spacetraders   first in, best dressed. The discounted meal ticket (3 in 1 Supreme meal) may be worth exploring (check HK Disneyland website). Had no issues bringing in some snacks water.

Take Sunscreen, hats or an umbrella for shade. A taxi from HK island with no traffic (not realistic some days) takes only 30 minutes. Way less hassle than 2 trains with small kids.Don't queue to meet the characters. Book well in advance for the enchanted restaurant buffet for dinner at the Disneyland resort hotel. They run shuttles. The characters go to every table. You can get tons of photos, a reasonable feed, & the kids will be beside themselves with excitement.Work out the parade time. And then stake out somewhere shady to watch it from. Best to be away from the park entrance as you just end up waiting way longer there. Take the road past tomorrowland for the most efficient viewing. When the kids need to cool down go to buzz light year or mickeys philharmonic.",Disneyland_HongKong

477359395,5,2017-1,Australia,"While it is the smallest of the parks we have visited, it feels like Hong Kong Disney opted for quality vs quantity. We found it refreshing to be able to see the park without rushing from ride to ride to see everything. As hotel guests, we were fortunate enough to be able to experience Iron Man, which was in its soft opening phase, and space mountain still had the Star Wars overlay. But it was the unique takes they had on rides that resulted in my two thumbs up. Mystic Manor was amazing, Grizzly Gulch was a good thrill and Jungle Cruise has it's own unique twist. Even more impressive was the in park dining. It was brilliant to walk away from a quick service meal having had something equally tasty and healthy. I admired the multilingual approach that rides took, often catering for Cantonese, Mandarin and English languages in clever ways. The best example of this was Mickey and the Wonderous Book. The only downside we found was the photopass, which operates and the same system as Shanghai, and there are simply not enough photopass photo opportunities!As we wanted to visit for three days and the tickets offered were a maximum of two days, we were recommended to look at upgrading to an annual pass, which we did and as a result have tacked Hong Kong onto our Tokyo trip.

477340830,5,2017-4,New Zealand,"I loved it. I'm an absolute Disney fiend though. The park was very clean (similar to other parks), and the cast were all very friendly. Didn't have very long wait lines for almost everything except in Fantasyland. Good dining food, but not great snacks like at some of the other parks. Would've liked to buy a hot dog or something more than popcorn but not ice cream. A bit small, would only need 1 day there. Easy to get to using the MTR. ",Disneyland_HongKong

477244562,5,2017-4,United States,"We just returned from our latest trip to Hong Kong and a visit to Hong Kong Disney. It did not disappoint. It is an English speaking Disney with wide tree lined sidewalks. Crowding is not an issue as it is in the United States as there is plenty of room to walk around. The park doesn't open until about 10am with some rides opening at 11am, like Small World. I recommend starting at the back of the park, then working your way to the front, since we have seen everyone else doing the opposite. Had no trouble riding everything multiple times, never needed a fast pass. The most beautiful Small World (and largest) is located here. It has a bridge and is just breath taking if you are a Small World fan. You may need a respirator when you see the size of it. Overwhelming for sure. Mystic Manor is an outstanding ride that rivals anything I have seen (technologically) at Disney World in Orlando. To get to this park, it is very easy to take the train in and out. You'll arrive at a very pretty Disney train station. There is lots of pin trading here, and Hong Kong pins are easy to get. What great souvenirs! Because this location is so close to the Big Buddha, you could do both on the same day. Go to Buddha in the morning (early) and beat the heat, then train over to Disney since they do not open until 10am. You can do this park in a day. Great for all ages.",Disneyland_HongKong
477170770,3,2017-4,United States,"If you have never visited any other Disney Park in the world, then this is a nice beginner's experience. The park is small and on a non peak day, you can ride all the rides in about three hours. I went to the park on a holiday peak day, but the longest line I had to wait on was marked 35 minute wait time but it was only 20 minutes. The Iron Man experience is the only exclusive ride there. Everything else can be found in other Disney Parks. (It's A Small World. Hyper Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters, Winnie The Pooh, etc.). It is missing a lot of iconic Disney Rides   Splash Mountain, Cinderella Carousel, etc.If you don't go to this park, you won't really miss much. I would not call this a must do attraction. The Tian Tun Buddha on Lantau Island is a MUST DO instead.",Disneyland_HongKong

We got there early and got into the rides straight away and waited no longer than 15 minutes. The rides are fantastic such as the small world, mystic manor plus many more.

The Grizzly Mountain ride was also a lot of fun. We did this twice and was worth the longer queues. We ate at the ethnic food section (Japanese, Korean, Indian) at 12pm. Lots of seating. Food was good value and yummy (for Disneyland). Included a drink. They took credit cards. ",Disneyland_HongKong
476869488,5,2017-4,United Kingdom,I loved Disney! It is a small park compared to Florida so probably one day or two is enough. I enjoyed the parades and the rides. We used the fast pass for iron Man ride and definitely was a time saver.,Disneyland_HongKong

476680394,4,2017-4,Australia,"I'm writing this review so that other travellers can get an idea of how busy it is at Hong Kong Disneyland during the Ching Ming festival. I could not find any information about how busy it would be on this particular public holiday so hopefully this information will be helpful for someone else.As we came in on a cruise we couldn't pick our day of arrival (or the time unfortunately) As a result we arrived late in the afternoon. Yes it was a little crowded but we didn't have to queue more than half an hour for our desired rides. We didn't get to check out all the classic rides at Fantasyland because we ran out of time. This was because we were forced to arrive so late in the day, not because we spent ages queueing elsewhere in the park.The only rides that we saw queues that went for more than an hour were in the Toy Story area. Luckily we weren't too fussed about going on them.This is definitely a park for younger children. We had children aged from 5 to 11 and they all loved it. None of the roller coasters have loops and the rides don't go too high on the thrill factor. The only characters we lined up for were at Tomorrowland. The line to see both BB8 and Chewbacca were really short. No one in our party were particularly interested in seeing Mickey and Co. so I couldn't tell you how long the wait was. Ask every staff cast member that you see if they have stickers. We became obsessed with collecting them.We bought the play and dine offer available on the website which meant that we got a free meal. The staff at the restaurant in Tomorrowland were really helpful to explain what we could order. The food was of a theme park standard. Plenty of western options available if your young one isn't open to trying the Asian options.Our highlights were the fairy garden, mystic manor, hyperspace mountain and the awesome fireworks show at the end of the day.I also had trouble trying to find out how much the Minnie Mouse ear headbands cost before coming to the park so here's the prices as at 4th April 2017: The headband with sequins was HKD138 and the plain polka dot ones were HKD118. My boys weren't really interested in the options available for them so I can't tell you how much the goofy hats cost.If there's a good deal going on cheap flights to Hong Kong i'm tempted to try and visit with the kids again (if only to get all the stickers, mwah hahahahaha!)",Disneyland_HongKong

476045167,5,2017-4,United Kingdom,"In order to differentiate this review from others, my opinion might be relevant to other Europeans visiting Disney Hong Kong whilst on holiday. We visited for one day right at the end of our 2 week trip around China and initially thought that all the logistics about what to do with our luggage would make the visit overly difficult. We solved this by checking in our 3 large hold suitcases at 9am at Kowloon Station for our later 11pm flight (a great idea from HKG airport) and then leaving our 3 hand luggage items in a large locker on Main St once inside the attraction (100 hkd for the day). At the fund of the day we then took the MTR from Disney to Tsing Yi MTR and the hopped onto the airport express line using our previously bought return tickets.Travel aside, we ( dad, mum and 8 y.o.) really enjoyed our single day here and felt that we had seen all we had wanted to see in a day. Others mention always spending 2 days in he park and I guess this would allow for a more leisurely experience but for us 10am to 6pm worked. In contrast when we visited Paris about 3 yrs ago there was no way to cover most things in a day   overall we felt as if Disney HKG was smaller than Paris, but this was no ad thing for us. Lastly, our personal highlights were the Lion King show, the Iron Man 3D simulator and meeting Chewbacca...",Disneyland_HongKong

476027265,5,2017-4,Australia,"My first ever visit to any Disneyland and had a great day. They have a priority time arrangements for the key rides whereby you book in and get priority access during your allotted time   allows you to see other things rides and come back and let inTry and position yourself for the 3 parades across the day and stay for the fireworks. Plenty of food options across the park.Transport is best using the MTR network, the trains returning are regular and you didn't have to line up, due to frequency. If I have one recommn cation, save the time and try purchase your entry tickets at your hotel, saves waiting in the long line to get in !!",Disneyland_HongKong
476002881,4,2017-4,Singapore,"This place was on our bucket list. So visited with our children. Overall a nice place. Typical Disneyland. We booked tickets through Klook, which got us Auto magic access without any need to wait in ticket lines. Automagic is nothing but getting your printed tickets from a machine by using QR code on your Klook tickets. So we just walked in within no time. All attractions are very nice. But the highlight is Disney Character parade during the day and in the evening with fireworks. The only difference is that the parade songs are in Mandarin language. A must do attraction is R Racer in Toy Story land something very thrilling. Make sure that you occupy the benches in front of Castle at around 615 630pm. That's the place with the best view of evening parade and fireworks. ",Disneyland_HongKong

475928189,5,2016-5,Philippines,"Been to the park 6 times as we always buy a 2 days pass. Disney magic is simply because they make each rides better than other theme parks. It is little things, could be like adding interactive feature or making the ride longer where you feel it was worth trying for every ride. You have to go though on a weekday or buy an express pass. You should also go when it opens. The rides in tomorrow land and fantasy land are usually long since it is close to entrance. The farther sections would have less. The shows are also great, the lines are long even on a weekday and I recommend falling in line early like as soon as they let people in so you seat at the front. Then there's the parade and fireworks. So one day is never enough.",Disneyland_HongKong

The park was empty. We never waited more then 15 minutes for any ride or show. The layout and rides of the park are similar then the California Disneyland. They are just themed differently.Compared to California Disneyland, park tickets were fairly cheap. Check with your hotel if they offer any discounts on tickets. We were able to save about 50 HKD per ticket by ordering tickets through our hotel.Overall, we had a great time here. It was really neat too see a differently Disneyland then we are use too.

The park is not as big as the one on Orlando but it has fantastic attractions to enjoy with the family. One day of course is not enough to visit all the attractions . I suggest to buy the 2 day pass in order to have plenty time to visit all the wonderful themed worlds around the park.My favorite , the mine roller coaster!!

Except if you want a photo with characters Mickey and Mini  get there as soon as they open or half an hour before and go to the main circle and start lining up first. The first day we caught the train from central HK city  terrible idea   took too long to get there. Caught an uber home. Very quick, luxury and not too much more than the train (family of 5). Next day uber there and back. The only downside I would say is lack of food options and availability. If you're travelling with young children take food and drinks. It takes too long to go and find a food stall and then when you do they only serve the same thing   nothing healthy. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Disney, has the best places to eat and the parades get better each time. This time was the spring parade and the welcoming band, it's such a pleasurable experience. My fav ride is Space Mountain, thrilling pitch dark roller coaster zooming on the rails whilst Star Wars tells you a story in the background! My tip is: do your shopping as you're going through the park and have the cashier desks deliver your parcels to the main counter at the exit. They will give you your bill and a pink slip. All you have to do is cut short the fireworks time by 5 minutes to collect your parcel from the exit gate's main counter before the park shuts. This way you can walk light as you explore the park, still do your shopping since waiting to visit Main Street till the night parade leaves you in a mad rush and crazy billing lines.

Make sure you visit any amusement pask on a Monday. The rush is less. There are many rides but mostly creative. Slow. There are no roller coasters in this. Except in the TOYS section one Horse shoe shaped ride.There are 2 parades worth watching and missing everything else in the world. Everything ends with a sound and fireworks show. Worth a visit one.,Disneyland_HongKong

474480221,3,2017-4,United Kingdom,"Cost us around   60 each for a ticket, which we didn't think was bad value to get into a Disney park. First off I have to say we have been lucky enough to visit Orlando Disney on many occasions so we found it difficult to not compare the two parks. We found staff to be lovely whenever we encountered them, no issues at all. The park was clean. We went to the Iron Man experience and have to be honest we all found it a little disappointing, it was a nice ride but think we expected more from it. We rode the Toy. Story space rangers ride which was the same a Orlando but it kept stopping   not sure if it was a technical issue but did detract from the ride a little. Witnessed some inconsiderate behaviour in the queues   people coming out the queues then literally shoving past people to get back in. We queued for a while to ride the Jungle River Rapids, we weren't overly impressed with this ride (although the staff worked hard to make it fun). We then went to Toy Story Land and rode the Racing Car ride   waited for 1 2 hour but it was well worth it   great ride. It was a nice day out, the castle was very underwhelming compared to Orlando, the park in general was much smaller but it is a nice park and worth a visit. We went on the MTR which was very easy to find our way to Disney,",Disneyland_HongKong
474474815,4,2017-4,Malaysia,Get there for it opening   we went in April and waited no more than 10 minutes for a ride   most 5 mins or straight on. Plenty of eating options and big range of souvenirs to buy. MTR very easy and cheap to get there. ,Disneyland_HongKong
474451880,4,2017-2,Philippines,"Notes on my review; my wife and I went as a couple to HK (didn't bring the kids along) and were on a tight budget. We haven't been to any other Disneyland theme parks. But we definitely made this as a  cannot miss  itinerary during our first visit to HK. 1). Be prepared for a lot of walking   It is a large theme park, so make sure you wear comfortable shoes (or slippers sandals), bring sufficient drinking water (depending on how much hydration you need), and wear comfortable clothing (depending on weather forecast or season). Moving from one theme area to another involves quite a lot of walking if you sum it all up. I had my pedometer on and clocked over 13k steps for the whole day we spent there. 2). Buy your ticket online   Decided to buy our tickets online to save a bit and avoid the queue at the ticket booths there. So when we got to Disneyland we were able to skip the line for tickets and went straight to the entrance. (We went on a weekday so I noticed the line wasn't so bad. But it does add to the time you waste waiting in line) 3). Allocate a whole day for this visit   With the size of the park, plus the different attractions, rides or activities. You definitely will need to plan this as a whole day visit. We were there from 11am to 8pm (to watch the fireworks) and we were just a couple visiting. If your bringing children along, being earlier (be there by 10am) will definitely give you a more relaxed pace to go around and enjoy a lot of the attractions. 4). Weekend or Weekday?   Important note, we went on a weekday so I don't have first hand experience on weekend volume of people (its just a hunch). If milling around in a park with a LOT of people trying to get in line to the different attractions is NOT your thing then I suggest going on a weekday. Fewer people   shorter lines   more attractions to visit or ride. Granted there are some attractions that might be closed, but its just a handful so it was not a big deal for me. Longest wait time we had for an attraction was at the carousel and it took us approx 10mins to get seated. I can just imagine the weekday crowd pushing the wait time to at least twice that duration (just a hunch). 5). Bring your own water and food   being on a budget, we brought our own food and water. At first I was thinking these might not be allowed but we got them through and saved some money. For portability we brought a few sandwiches and 3L of water (for the both of us). 6) Notes on gadgets   make sure your phones cameras are fully charged and bring extra powerbanks and maybe memory (if you tend to take a ton of pictures and videos) if your phone camera has limited capacity. Having pictures and videos of your visit is a mortal sin (okay, not a sin but helps build nice memories) when visiting Disneyland. There are also certain areas with free wifi in the park so that helps you in updating your twitter, instragram or facebook accounts as you are experiencing the wonder of Disneyland. 7). Check the schedule of activities on their website or app   To make sure you don't miss on any major shows   activities. Make sure to check their website or app for whatever is happening on the day you plan to visit. This will help you decide what to watch or visit as some shows or activities overlap one another. 8). Check the HK forum for advice, suggestions and tips on Disneyland   I'm an organized   planning person, so doing research on where I'm visiting is a must. Check the HK forums here at Tripadvisor and you'll get tons of advice or answer to questions.",Disneyland_HongKong
474439282,4,2017-4,Australia,"GET THERE EARLY! Being the first time at this park I thought it was ok. I would love to bring the grandkids here as they would love it. I enjoyed all the attractions. Two were closed for refurbishment so if you are keen on a particular area, I would contact ahead to avoid any disappointment. Reasonably priced as far as parks go. Overall, great for kids.

474373145,5,2017-4,Russia,What can say   I wish we could come back again. One thing I would advise the Park's administration to think about is some quiet air conditioned places for people to have some rest. At the moment we can see grannies who sleep under the bridge or mothers with small kids who feed them on a windowsills in Disney stores and staff members who chase them. That would be really customer friendly. ,Disneyland_HongKong

We have visited three other Disney lands worlds across the world and this is definitely the smallest, but perfect for young children. The major issue at the park is the staff   they are definitely lacking the Disney magic that you come to expect, especially in the American parks. They are often rude and very unhelpful, although you do come across the odd gem!

Don't forget to buy meal tickets as well because the food inside Disneyland is a bit pricey. Aside from the rides we got a bit gaga over original items that you can find in their stores and mind you there are plenty of stores scattered around the park! You should try the Grizzly ride and it's not for the faint at heart. Same with the mountain space ride. The new Toy story attraction is worth the longline and will definitely go back. Make sure to witness both the afternoon and evening parade of the charcters and the finale which is the fireworks display. It was exhausting and one day is not enough!

The Disney experience starts with Disney Line. This train is pretty cool with Mickey shaped windows and hand holds. We can see the excitement in the kids riding this train! There is a little bit of walking from the training station to the park entrance. There were two food trucks on the way to the park entrance so you can stop to eat before or after visiting the park. The park itself is smaller than Disneyland or Disney World. That is a plus because we didn't get as tired going through the park. The Star War tour has been converted to an Iron Man Experience which we dubbed the  Stark Tour.  We always enjoy this ride. There is no Haunted Mansion here, instead they have the Mystic Manor ride. We loved it. The character creation, back stories, and animation is exceptional. This has become my daughter's favorite ride. There are many more of the fun disney rides. They have churros! We watched the parade in the afternoon and later the electric lights parade at night.Disneyland have buses to go to the resort hotels; but it is back where the train stop is; so it is quite a walk to get there.

472520863,5,2017-3,Singapore,"Before we hopped over to the park, we did a session for our two girls at Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique. It is the make over studio for girls to become the princess of their dreams. My pre schoolers had great fun. One chose to be Rapunzel and one chose to be Anna. The staff were friendly and cheerful and put our girls at ease very quickly. After the make over, the photographer came to take photos of the girls. During the photo session, parents are welcome to take photos using their own cameras. Only 1 photo in a nice folder is included in the package. You can purchase more at additional costs (HKD 160 each or HKD 1600 for a hard coffee table book consisting of 10 photos). The staff were not pushy at all when it came to the photos. No pressure to purchase any additional photos at all. They also took home all the costumes, hairpiece, boxes of rings (Disney Princesses themed, of course), earring stickers and a little bottle of nail polish. Just a reminder, you have to make an appointment prior to the session. We made the appointment months before when we booked our room at the resort. I tried to change the appointment time closer to the day and was told the timing of our choice was full. I think they are quite busy. While we were in there, there was a steady stream of little princesses (to be) coming in and little princesses going out. And it was considered very low peak season when we were there as the park was not crowded at all. For 1 little princess, do be prepared to spend a little over an hour in the boutique as there is the choosing the costume to be done (depending on whether your little one is a fast decision maker or not), the actual make over, the photo taking (assuming no queue) then the choosing of the photos on the iPad and finally waiting a few minutes to receive the photo.The girls enjoyed themselves, we enjoyed seeing the girls dolled up and they have loads of fun with the costume at home nowadays so I would say it was worth the (hefty) price(tag).

Very easy to get there from central Hong Hong by train and the whole journey and the park itself incredibly buggy friendly. The park wasn't too big yet felt spacious once inside. Lots of rides and attractions for toddlers and the queues were better than we expected, perhaps Markham is still low season. The park so clean and easy to navigate. Would definitely recommend.

471360019,4,2017-3,United States,"I've been to Disneyland in Anaheim, California and Disney World in Orlando, Florida in the United States, and this is definitely the most compact Disney park I've been to. But there is an advantage to its small size: You walk less. This is especially advantageous if you have very young children. In Disneyland or Disney World, you must do so much walking that even the adults poop out after half a day. The HK Disney Park is so compact and if you go on a weekday, you could finish visiting the Park in half a day! I was there today, arriving by MTR in the morning at about 10:45 (It opened at 10:30). There were no long lines awaiting to go in. I went straight to the entrance turnstile and show the attendant my ticket code (I ordered the ticket online early in the morning), and he processed my ticket immediately. I walked down Main Street (by passing all the photo opportunities with Disney characters) and went straight to Tomorrowland. There I immediately went to the Iron Man ride which I expected to be the most crowded since it's Disney's newest ride. I was surprised that I was in my seat within 10 minutes. I followed it with Hyperspace Mountain, Starwars Command Post, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blaster and Orbitron (since all were in Tomorrowland), and all waited no more than 10 minutes. I then went to the next theme section, Fantasyland, and tried their most popular ride, Winnie the Pooh, and once again the wait was no more than 10 minutes. I followed that ride with one of Disneyland's best known, It's A Small World, was able to walk right in. Then went to see the shows Mickey and the Wondrous Book and Mickey's PhilharMagic, and once again walked right in without waiting. I wanted to watch Festival of the Lion King in Adventureland but it was closed until April. So I went to Grizzley Gulch but decided I did not care to ride the Mine Cars Rollercoaster so I proceeded to the Mystic Manor which is similar to the old Haunted Mansion and once again was in within 10 minutes. I entered the park at 10:45 a.m. was actually ready to leave at 3:00 p.m. If it were not for the afternoon parade which started at 3:45 p.m. I would have departed at 3:00 p.m. I did not have to use the Fast Pass feature of my ticket at all and was able to repeat a couple of rides with very little waiting. So from this, I conclude that you can do this park in one day if you go on a weekday and arrive by opening time. But like all Disneylands, I recommend you have a plan of routing before going to save yourself time and unnecessary steps. Here are some of my suggestions after being there today: 1. Order your tickets online to save waiting in line to purchase tickets. 2. Bring water and small snacks (cookies, chocolate bars, trail mix packs) but leave your lunch size sandwiches behind as park security will not allow bringing food items into the park.3. The MTR ride from the Hong Kong Station to the Disney Station takes at least half and hour, so allow yourself adequate time for transportation in order to get there by opening time.4. Once you enter the park, by pass photos with all the Disney characters on Main Street and go to the Information Board to the right of the Circle before reaching the Castle and check ride closures and show parade times. 5. Then head straight for the first ride on your planned route. Most people in Hong Kong don't seem to be early birds so you should not have to wait long for these first few rides.6. Be sure to work in the shows into your schedule: Mickey & the Wondrous Book, Mickey's PhilharMagic and Festival of the Lion King. 7. Lastly, also work in the afternoon and the evening parade (if you're staying til closing) as well as the fireworks show to complete your Hong Kong Disney adventure.",Disneyland_HongKong

We spent most of the time in Tomorrow Land , Toy Story Land and Adventure Land.Jungle River Cruise around 6.45pm (just before it closes at 7pm) was amazing.

I was there with my 4yo and 8yo kids during the weekdays and it was not very crowded. Probably also because it was drizzling, and we're glad that the heavy rainpour happened in the early morning before the park opens. I'm lucky that I did not encounter any bad behaviors from the mainlanders which I read in some of the posts. I would think that 1 day is enough to cover the whole place. But if you are like us who likes to take pictures and autographs from the characters, 2 days will be a comfortable pace so as to cover the rides, shows and parades. The shows are good, make sure to catch them when you are there. We enjoyed ourselves on the ride. The parades were entertaining and the firework was fantastic. Do be mindful that you are not allowed to bring food to Disneyland, but sandwiches are OK. We bought the burger bun at the bus food kiosk outside Disneyland and I simply love it.

Some suitable for teenages and above like Grizzly gulch. I never expected the roller coaster would run backwards with high speed! I also thought the fireworks was those normal fireworks show at night. But, alot of audience started fill up the place in front of the Sleeping Beauty castle 1 hour before the performance and the whole place was even full after the night parade. I also noticed that this theme park not only full of kids and parents but, old people and old couples were enjoying themselves too.

Grizzly Gulch was classic Disney. Amazing! A great new interpretation of Big Thunder Mountain. So much fun, and just AWESOME!  Iron Man Experience! This surprised me how much I liked it! A great motion simulator designed after StarTours, this ride really takes you to the streets of Hong Kong with Iron man as you battle evil! Incredibly well done!   Festival of the Lion King   this version is a bit different from the Orlando version, but it is amazing!!!! inspiring, fun and a must see  All 3 Parades   there were 3 parades when we visited and they were all must see! Just pure disney magic!   Hyperspace Mountain   this redo of space mountain featuring StarWars, was INCREDIBLE. I was surprised how much I liked it. Simply brilliant and fun!  Fireworks.

We didn't need to try out the express pass system which took the pressure off although looking at the queue areas there is obviously a lot of people on a fine day.Surprisingly we all enjoyed the Mystic Manor with its journey through each area with the story unfolding as you go great.

And save you a lot of trouble walking back and forth. It also tells you the wait times for the popular rides. Free wifi is available at the park. You will have to sign in every 15mins because that is the max limit their allowed for each time you log in. The park is very clean.

The park itself is not huge, but enjoyable for my 5 year old daughter. The bonus was that there were hardly any queues and we managed to return multiple times to her favourite rides. The food offering was limited and really bad ... A number of dining joints were closed ... Worth taking your little ones.",Disneyland_HongKong
469006478,5,2017-3,United States,Just like Disneyland in the states this is truly the happiest place on earth. This is a must do for anyone visiting Hong Kong with or without kids. The best part is it's much cheaper than both Disneyland and Disney world!,Disneyland_HongKong
468950199,5,2017-3,United States,This park is very different from Disneyworld in Orlando. It is much smaller. We were only there for half a day and we felt like we saw most of it. I think 1 to 2 days would be the maximum. It was easy to navigate and the attractions were inventive. We loved the Toy Story park! The only downside we noticed was that there wasn't a  fine dining  option for dinner there (unlike Orlando) as we wanted to have dinner for my cousin's birthday.,Disneyland_HongKong
468898533,5,2017-3,Philippines,it was a very pleasent visit and we intend to repeat it. warning: one day is tight. really have to experience sleep over.,Disneyland_HongKong
468873634,5,2017-3,Australia,"A great day out with plenty to do. Although not as big as Anaheims Disneyland there is still plenty to keep you occupied with plenty of the old favourites like it's a small world, tea cups and Dumbo ride.",Disneyland_HongKong
468809958,4,2017-3,South Korea,"Went in March, which it was warm but not hot and humid, so it was comfortable in terms of weather. Also, went on Monday to avoid weekenders. There were basically no lines for rides and it wasn't crowded at all. So, perhaps weekdays could be ideal. We've been to Orlando, CA and Tokyo Disney and I would say Hong Kong is the smallest (not a bad thing!). The hours are shorter as well (ends at 8:30pm or so). So, it's a good one day event and don't really need to spend more than a day unless it's too crowded and you can't get on all the rides. We got there little after opening time (opened at 10:30am) and it was plenty of time to go through it all. When walking up from the subway station (not sure on bus or taxi but subway was super easy and recommended with the Octopus card, the public subway transfers directly to Disney train tram), we noticed luggage valet area where you can drop off your luggage and pick it up later. I thought this was a nice service if you need to check out of hotel and you got a late flight out. I think it was only $100HK. The rides are mostly similar and or same vs other Disney parks but there's some new unique to Hong Kong. I would say it's more tailored to younger family as the rides are not as scary or hard. Our kids are 6 and 9 and they had a blast. Even Toy Story RC ride was good enough for adults while kids thought it was fun. It's a small world ride is also updated with Disney characters and they did a great job with a classic ride. In all, just keep your expectations in check and you will have fun. ",Disneyland_HongKong
468724925,4,2017-2,India,Spent two days there and had a good experience......but we visited paris disney last year so in comparison to that the staff didnt seem to be very up to the standard....though there were some who were really helpful.Like disney paris has the concept of the character autographs which my kids really enjoyed but everytime we asked the staff at HK disney they seemed a lil annoyed. The afternoon and evening parade were both amazing. Overall fun days spent...Disney is magical as always,Disneyland_HongKong

468575966,4,2017-3,Singapore,"I have been here three times in the past 5 years and I observe that the crowd in HK is less than Disneyland Tokyo or even Paris (esp now that Shanghai Disneyland is open, most China tourists go there instead of HK one). The new attractions   Iron Man Experience and Hyperspace Mountain are super cool. Thrill seekers will also love Big Grizzly Mountain. Go for those rides! The queue is not too long (manageable). Food wise  i think Royal Banquet Hall in Fantasyland has the best range of food (international, Jap and grill). Price is around $120 140 per set. If you are planning this as your last day activity before flying off (like we did. Our flight is at 9pm), take a taxi from Disneyland to the airport. Cheaper and faster. Only around HKD120 (including luggages fees) and you need not transfer trains. ",Disneyland_HongKong
468507370,3,2017-3,Malaysia,"I visited this place together with my sister's family and this was the second Disneyland I have visited. The other one was the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California.The positive aspects: We enjoyed the Ironman ride, the Star Wars hyperspace mountain ride, the Mystic manor ride, the Grizzly Gulch runaway mine cart ride, the Lion King show, Mickey's Magical book show and Mickey's Philharmagic show. You need to plan your schedule in the theme park carefully in order to get to see the shows at the designated times. Long queues for the rides is a normal sight, you have to be patient and be prepared to queue up between 45 minutes and 1 hour for each ride.The negative aspects: Not surprisingly, 85% of the visitors to this Disneyland comprise of mainland Chinese tourists. The worst thing about this is, these people are really rude, rowdy, impatient and down right ill mannered. They let their young children pee all over the place in public instead of taking them to the washrooms, which are conveniently located all over the theme park! Here is an example; while we were queueing for the Disney train ride within the park(the train which takes visitors from Fantasyland to the main street station), there was a mainland Chinese family who had a toddler of around 3 years old behind us in the queue. The toddler told his father that he needed to answer a call of nature and the father told him to do it right there and then, on the pavement!!! We watched in horror as the father unzipped the boy's trousers and let him pee right on the pavement, 2 feet away from us!!!!!! Totally disgusting!!!!!! That wasn't the only such incident we witnessed!!! All day long, as we walked around the park, we saw countless such incidents where mainland Chinese families let their children pee in the planter boxes, flower shrubs, next to the lamp posts and on the pavements in public!!!If you and your family want to have a great, enjoyable experience in a Disney theme park, do not come here! Please visit the Disneyland in Anaheim, California. People there are more civilized, civic conscious, hygienic, courteous and well mannered.",Disneyland_HongKong

The park opens at around 10:30 a.m. and closes at 8 p.m. Plan your day well so you can cover all the shows and as many rides.

We had the blessed opportunity to all the existing Disney Parks (Florida, Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo, Los Angeles). Let me give you some real expectations.  it's small, the smallest of all the parks.  the rides are very different: Haunted Mansion is actually called Mystic Manor and is very light hearted and has no mentions of ghosts or ghouls. No  99 Happy Haunts.    instead of churros they have pressed squid.  staff is VERY polite and friendly.   the castle is small.  ... saying everything is small turned out to be one of the BEST aspects of the entire trip!!! 3 min lines for rides, we walked up to a parade in progress, we stayed to watch the fireworks   5 people from the front row, easy to navigate the park. ... it was just amazing. It wasn't a crowd of people and 2 hour waits for a 2minute ride. It was a genuinely relaxing and fun experience.   the food was incredible! This is for both the park and the Disney Hollywood Hotel.  lots of great artwork, Disney style.... there you go. Now go.",Disneyland_HongKong

468038244,3,2017-3,United States,"Another trip to Hong Kong Disneyland. I have been here over twenty times. I must say that the overall standards in terms of service and attitude have decreased dramatically. There are still some cast members that try to do their jobs as best as possible, but it is evident that most of them display a hatred for their jobs. Everything is getting more expensive, but it clearly does not reflect in their guest service and guest interaction. Hardly any smiles and no one goes out of their way to make it a magical moment for the guests. When my mom who was actually very happy to come to Disneyland this month wanted to take a photo with a storm trooper, she was denied. However, when it was evident that there two obvious looking foreigners, then they gave them exceptional service and allowed them to take photos and gave them handshakes. This type of behavior should not exist at Disneyland and it shows that management does a really poor job on training and oversight. Overall, it was a very substandard service kind of day. The food is just okay. It used to be better. Hopefully, management will read enough of these reviews to care to better manage their parks and resorts.",Disneyland_HongKong

467718754,5,2016-10,Indonesia,"Friends advised that this is a great park to visit with young children. We took our daughter for her eighth birthday and it certainly didn't disappoint.Having done a lot of research we spread our visit over a day and a half in the middle of the week. This was perfect. There was barely a queue for any ride we wanted to go on. The day and a half meant we didn't have to rush on anything and gave us time to queue to see Mickey and Minnie and revisit our favourite rides. We used the spare half day to get our daughter a princess make over at the Bibbidi Bobbidi boutique and go for a character dinner at the Enchanted garden in the Disneyland hotel.This is a park suited to younger children. A few of the rides are quite young i.e. the teacups. That said, there is the ubiquitous space mountain, the brilliant run away mine cars (our favourite) and several others to keep the wider family amused. There are  characters  all over the park, ranging from the traditional characters and princesses right through to storm troopers and Stitch (from Lilo and Stitch). My biggest tip is to walk right on past the first mickey and minnie you will see just inside the park. We did queue for these on the second morning and waited an hour and half! We didn't mind as we had already done most of the park on the first day so had the time. Walk on by and you will no doubt see more Mickey and Minnies in other parts of the park with no queues.The park has the usual Disney day time and evening parades with the fireworks. These are not on the scale you might see in WDW in Florida. As an example we saw 3 floats in the day time parade. Together with the dancers it had passed us within about 10 minutes. But you won't fight for a spot to see it and the kids are still blown away by the whole thing. The night time fireworks were really brilliant.A particular tip is to make time to see the Lion King performance. It was absolutely outstanding and really worth doing. This alone is a good reason to do more than one day at the park as the timing of the performances can get tight with also seeing things like the day time parade. We did find eating here a little bit of a challenge. There are lots of places selling high sugar or on the go snacks, but not many options to eat properly. This can be a bit of a challenge if you're staying for the whole day (the park closes at 8), and have hungry kids. We went to the main street corner cafe which was ok but nothing great.It's worth being aware of the location. If you don't know, HK is on several islands and so it can take a bit of time to get out to Disney. There are public transport options but if you're just visiting HK and really want to do the whole park I would recommend staying at the resort (there are two hotels) as it does give you more flexibility. We mixed a stay at first in the city with two nights at Disney and this worked well.The staff are the usual friendly Disney crew. Lots of smiles, and stickers for the kids. Basically this place has all the right Disney magic without the crowds! A winner for me.",Disneyland_HongKong
467685300,4,2017-2,United States,"We went on a Monday, there was no line longer than 30 minutes. Compared to the Disney's in the US, it was much smaller, but worth the price.

We took many photos of the beautiful art pieces like castle, take a ride and it seemed that we are truly on a magical world. We spent one day walking around the place and satisfies with what we have seen. We also take the most exciting rides and shout like there's no tomorrow.

Weather was okey and it was so quiet! Unbelievable. We could do every attraction twice and even had some time left. I loved the Grizzly train and Mystic Mansion. The last one is one of the best attractions I've ever been in. I was disapointment of the Iron Man Experience and the fact that a lot of restaurants where closed.Overall a fun day and a must do for Disney lovers. ,Disneyland_HongKong

467261430,5,2017-3,Canada,All the fun and excitement of any Disneyland park.... just a little smaller with an Asian touch. Get there right at 10am. Hit your most wanted attraction first then easily cruise around and see the rest of the park all day. Food and drink is not cheap but what is at Disney. A couple must go on rides. Space mountain. RC Remote in toy story land. Mine car canyon in adventureland. Scary for kids but fun scary..... the Lion King performance is great as well. Full on live musical show with lots for all ages to enjoy. Try not to tap your feet or sing along.... bet you can't. Both parades are great. Sit near the city hall to see them. Best view point. Get to the curb 20 30 minutes early to get a seat. Fireworks are good. Not GREAT but worth staying for. Ride the MTR home. Mickey has his own spur line to the park from the Sunny Bay station. Enjoy. Magical. ,Disneyland_HongKong

467025852,4,2017-3,United States,"We have been all 6 Disney parks now. This is the 4th best but still fun to go see. You can do the park in 1 2 to 3 4 a day. The park opened at 1030am, but somem of the areas did not open until 11am, so you need to listed and plan accordingly. The grizzley Gulch coaster and the  haunted mansion   not really haunted but really cool   are a must see. Winnie pooh and Buzz were closed so that was a little disappointing. The simulator on Iron Man is a must do as well. The Space Mountain was redone to now have scenery that is like you are in Star Wars jet shooting at the Empire. Best Space Mtn ride of all of them. Its a Small World was even a little better as the scenary is different and includes Disney Princesses in each set, which is fun to find for the kids. Go early as there are multiple line checks to get in. Buy tickets ahead of time as 2 3 of the people that went thru security stopped to get tickets there.",Disneyland_HongKong
466807543,5,2017-2,Philippines,"My first advice is for you to download the Disneyland App. Wifi is free all over the amusement park so even if you do not have mobile data, no worries. Having the mobile app is definitely a must.The app will show the schedule of the shows, where the characters are for photo op, it will also help you to go around the park and look for the attractions. Having the app will let you plan your activities better and you will not definitely miss or simply choose which attractions you will visit first.I recommend that you reserve one whole day of your vacation here at Disneyland alone.Fast track tickets are also highly recommended and plan on using it strategically :)Food and souvenir items are kinda expensive but YOLO so don't be too stingy and splurge a little bit.Every part in every ride is well thought off and the details in every attractions are all spot on! I feel that I am part of the story in every ride and attraction that we visited. The parade during the afternoon and evening are also a must see!But the most important thing that you cannot miss out on is the fireworks display. This will seal the deal. This will make every dollar that you spent counts. This will definitely bring you back to your childhood (and for me, it brought tears to my eyes especially during the  A Whole New World Song , I was even singing it on our way home and before I sleep)Your trip to Hong Kong will not be complete without visiting HK Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong
466787577,5,2017-3,Australia,"We went to Disneyland today and honestly in made me feel like a child again, so many different choices of rides and attractions to see. Make sure you stay for the night Parade and also the fireworks at night time as these are not to be missed. Dont waste your time waiting for the tarzan boat ride not worth it, i found this the most boring ride and longest wait time (45mins on a monday) in the entire place. Best ride by far would be the mine car rollercoaster followed closely by the star wars ride. RC rollercoaster in toy story land was also very good. A top tip would be to arrive to the lion king and mickey mouse shows 20mins early as they do turn people away if there are too many people already in line",Disneyland_HongKong
466702444,5,2016-12,India,"The Hong Kong Disneyland is one of the quickest ways to experience Disneyland. It is not as large as the other Disneylands but it give a good experience. If on a short trip or passing through Hong Kong with kids, it would be worth a visit. One day is enough to cover almost all the rides as the waiting time is mostly between 10mins and 30mins. The Disneyland is a bit away from Hong Kong city so it is recommended to travel by the special train that goes all the way to Disneyland station. Moreover that ride itself provides an experience as the interiors of the train features some Disney characters and even the train windows are customised in that theme. Tickets can be bought online and using the barcode in the confirmation email we can print the tickets using self service machines at the park entrance. If you are spending part of the time to take pictures with the Disneyland characters then it may take more time to cover the whole park as the queues for these photo sessions were long and most of the time the characters would be available in intervals only. It is worth waiting for the procession that starts around 7pm. Show is quiet impressive. Can be enjoyed by kids as well as adults. Later in the night there is a fireworks show which you can wait for if there is enough time. Recommended to visit the park during winter times to get a better over all experience. There are a few restaurants inside the park catering dishes from all over the world so there will be something for everyone. Overall it is recommended for kids including younger kids as it is quiet easy to manage them in this park. The latest attraction during my visit   The Iron Man experience was not yet open to public but was available for those staying at the Disneyland hotel. Probably at the time of writing this review it would have been open to public. The two hotels inside the park are relatively expensive and I don't recommend to stay there as it will also be far away from Hong Kong city making it difficult to travel back and forth. If only visiting the Disneyland then it's ok to stay there and experience it. I did not find any restriction for photography and equipments like tripod, monopod. But it will be better to use a light camera and multipurpose lens. During the evening fireworks or processions we can use the tripod if required. Until then lockers can be utilised to keep valuables and accessories. ",Disneyland_HongKong

The day we went was not crowded and not hot, which makes a big difference. In USA, they open the gates early, however, they do not do it here. We got there an hour early and it didn't open until stated opening time. Food wasn't great. We loved the Toy Story area. So creative and different from USA.

Find out the timing and go early to find a good spot to sit because it gets really crowded very quickly and prepare to take lotsa photos! ",Disneyland_HongKong
466212708,5,2016-10,Philippines,Hong Kong is the very first outside country a traveled and it we were so exciting to go there. We spent our first day at the Hong Kong Disneyland and it was tiring yet fun. I love the ambiance as well as their one time entrance fee which you can ride unlimited. Had out lunch inside costing 220 300HKD. I love also the time during afternoon parade it was so looong and full of excitement. I saw many Filipinos their like me. It like im not outside the country .,Disneyland_HongKong
466191069,4,2016-12,India,"Hi guys, I have heard a lot about The Disneyland across the world but decided to visit HK and witness the show there being from India. First let me speak about the attraction and then the reason I chose to visit HK. I would like to specify that the premises is spread wide enough that you cannot cover the complete attraction in 1 day for sure even if you just play two games in one division (there are about 8 9 divisions in the complete attraction). Hence, I suggest that you book your accommodation along with the tickets for the attraction. First time visitors can definitely go ahead. I would like to inform you that you cannot carry any food into Disneyland. Only water from outside is allowed into the park. You have MTR service directly reaching the park from the mainland. You can also reach the park which is close to the Airport by bus and cab. Now coming to the reason for the visit to HK Firstly.... it is one of the tourist destination close to India featuring Disneyland, Second... it is a good tourist destination having lot of attractions near by like Macau and Shenzen. Third .... you get to have edible veg cuisine and a lot of sea food cuisine if you are in HK.",Disneyland_HongKong
466180948,5,2016-12,India,"One of the most amazing experiences i had. We took the tickets from Admirality MTR which were also discounted tickets. From clicking pics with Minie, Minnie, Goofy and the squirrels everything is fantastic. The ticket cost covers the cost of rides and one does not have to pay anything extra. Best parts include Toy land rides, Grizzly the bear ride. Take the Jungle River Cruise at night with fire and lights, railroad which covers almost the entire disneyland, Mickeys Phillar magic which is not to be missed   one can actulaay have watere drops coming on face! ; Snow White which is must for girls, Geyser Gluch awesome, and many more. RC Racer is Toy land is not for faint hearted but awesome. Winnie the Pooh is for small kids but they will love it. Be here at least at hour before the opening hours to get the maximum rides as queues are at least for 45 minutes in rides. The Castle is beautiful and the entire place is fit for lots of pics. Its a good place for vegetarians and yummy food pure vegetarian food is offered in Tahitian Terrace. It is bit pricey but worth it. Large enough to give a fill. Night parade is a must and not to be missed. A must to visit place. Dont carry any baggae along as they charge a lot for storage. If you wish to buy then clothes in certain stores are of comeitive prices otherwise they are pricey. The Disneyland Metro train which takes you the land is beautiful and has the windows carved out as the face of mickey. Its a beautiful train. The last show which takes place as Disney in Stars is again not to be missed. The land closes after this show so make your way towards Mickey Metro rail which is the only option to move out of the place. In the last do not miss, Chip and Dale in Main Street, Snow White at Snow Castle, fantasy parade which takes place in afternoon at main street and festival of lion King. To see the entire place one has to walk a lot, so be ready for long happy walks",Disneyland_HongKong
466167527,4,2017-2,Australia,This was out first Disneyland experience and enjoyed it even though it is obviously more targetted for families with small children. It had a  feel good  vibe and was a relaxing environment even with crowds,Disneyland_HongKong
465928751,1,2017-3,Hong Kong,"Let me preface by writing we have been to Disney Florida and Disney California. Took my 4 year old twins to HK with me on business and decided to bring them to HK Disney as a treat. My children are biracial Caucasian Asian. I am Caucasian, mom is Asian.My son has light brown hair dark blonde hair and hazel eyes with some minimal Asianfeatures (e.g., no epicanthic eyefold so his eyes look more Westen while his bone structure is more Asiatic). His twin sister has a darker complexion and aside from medium brown hair eyes, she looks like a light skinned Asian toddler.My son was constantly hassled by Japanese and Korean patrons in the park, mostly obnoxious women between the ages of 30 40 years old who not only asked completely inappropriate and racists questions of my wife and I, but also thought it acceptable andOK to take selfies with my son. One of the women, a woman from Osaka, keptreferring to my son as  cute half breed boy. I put a stop to this after around the 8th or 9th Japanese Korean woman did this (mind you this was in the first two hours we were in the park). The final straw for me was when we went to a Disney stage show and the had an Asian woman made up in black face paintperforming a circa  1950's America  song a la Beans & Cornbread in front of a thousandlittle kids.Given the insane price of entry, small size and limited features of this Disney park, notto mention the  merchandizing attempts  every five feet and the profoundly racist experiences we had to deal with, I am crossing this off as a  we'll visit them again  place for the kids. The Ocean Park nearby is much better and nobody thought my childwas a park attraction toy for taking cell phone photos.I'd skip Disney HK and opt for the stateside parks. Maybe we will try Disney Shanghai with better luck.",Disneyland_HongKong

465580626,4,2017-1,United Kingdom,"Stepping into the world of Disney is always an exciting one. The Disneyland at Hong Kong is no different and in fact you tend to spend less time queuing here than the other Disney parks around the world. Yes it's not the biggest of the Disney parks, but it's great for a day visit or two. We went on the new Iron Man Experience which I didn't think was all that great, but Toy Story land is fantastic, great design and you feel like a big kid. Make sure you stay for the 'Paint the Night Parade' which is simply Disney at it's best, it's one of the best parade's i've ever seen and I would have made the visit just to see it!",Disneyland_HongKong

465571266,3,2016-6,Hong Kong,"HK Disney is small but they have built more and more since it was first opened. So every time I go back, there's a new ride waiting for me. For visitors who just want to visit once, then save it for later days as more rides will be available.They host some special night time events nowadays, look out for those events and they could make your visit more interesting.Transportation is fairly easy, and there's always a parking spot for you if you drive.",Disneyland_HongKong

465450247,4,2017-3,Singapore,Arrived during the 2nd week of March and had a 2 day admission ticket .There were relatively little crowds during the weekdays and the temperature during this time is cool between 18 to 23 degrees Celsius. The park must visit rides include the iron man experience and for pre schoolers all rides in fantasy land. The picture taking with the various characters would take up most of ur time as crowds magically appear whenever these sessions are on. ,Disneyland_HongKong

We got the ticket with the dining offer (that offers one combo meal at designated restaurants in the park) and it was value for $.There are new attractions as compared to my last trip like e Iron Man n the toy story.There is even a night parade that is one hour before the fireworks. The fireworks has reinvented itself by having a laser show at the same time!Overall, it was a fun experience for my child!",Disneyland_HongKong
465212338,5,2016-9,Philippines,"We have always loved Disneyland and this Park is one of them. In Asia, this is one of the most accessible and easy one to go to. I think it is the smallest though compared to all other DisneyParks but the fun is just the same!",Disneyland_HongKong
465171726,5,2017-3,Malaysia,This place is a must visit for families with kids especially the night parade . The place is clean n child friendly only one minus point the food is very expensive as outside food are not allowed in but the good part we can get halal food so forget about the price although it may cost as much if not even more than the tickets,Disneyland_HongKong

464707108,4,2017-2,Philippines,Been looking forward to my first visit and it didn't disappoint :) Loved everything we visited. Since I'm weak hearted no adventurous rides for me but still enjoyed the tamer rides and all the sites. Seeing the parades with familiar Disney characters and of course the fireworks show at the end made me tear up with happiness. And I am already old :) really awakened the kid in me,Disneyland_HongKong
464643266,5,2017-2,Australia,"After waiting years for the children to grow we were finally there and the place lived up to ALL expectation. The park was clean, well and thoughtfully laid out, easy to get around and the staff were helpful, polite and most of all understood what we were saying. Plenty of refuelling stops, lots of merchandise to purchase relevant to the area theme and plenty of seats to sit and just chill. We had a 2 day pass and it was well worth it, to purchase the extra day was only $40, whereas if we had purchased a 2nd separate day it would have cost the full fee and believe me $40 is a lot cheaper than $480. Overall it was a fantastic experience in the happiest place in the world, oh and I had my photo taken with Chewbacca",Disneyland_HongKong
464634402,4,2016-10,Australia,"I have been to other Disneylands many times. The Hong Kong Disneyland is very well done as Disney always is. It Is a smaller park with many very good live shows. There are not many big rides such as rollercoasters and fast rides. But overall the park was lovely. My grandson had a great time in Fantasyland, the buzz ride, Toy Story land etc. I would definitely return with small children.",Disneyland_HongKong

464622282,5,2017-1,Australia,Went again   now our third time with the kids. Lines were short. People friendly and a great place to go. We spent one day here and then came back to do the rest  otherwise its too tiring for the kids.,Disneyland_HongKong
464590351,3,2017-2,France,Went there as it's my girl's birthday. Nothing exciting as has been here many times. Staff at the ticket booth not friendly n feel agitated when dealing with customers unlike the first time when we visit when they were newly opened. Now there is express ticket counter where we can get n need not wait for long g time however we did not try this as park was not crowded. Lion King show is fantastic. They have only one new ride.,Disneyland_HongKong
464587012,4,2017-3,Italy,"Small Disneyland park, perfect for kids of 3 6 years old. If there are not many queues, you can experience almost all the attractions in one full day. Night parade highly recommended: very involving!",Disneyland_HongKong
464523121,2,2016-8,Hong Kong,It's always packed here with long lines for everything   especially the rides. The rides are all very short and not very thrilling   I know Disney is meant to be for all ages but the rides feel like they are made exclusively for kids under 10. Add that with the crowds and I'd rather wait the several years it'll take me to go to the real DisneyWorld.,Disneyland_HongKong
464495826,5,2017-3,New Zealand,My husband and I had a wonderful day at HongKong Disney land! Very tidy and inviting areas. Every ride we went on had us smiling and laughing. I didn't want to leave and the gift shops are amazing.,Disneyland_HongKong
464484513,4,2017-2,United Kingdom,"It brought out the child in me. We visited on a week day and found it easily on the MRT (it has its own line and even the train was Disney themed). We were concerned we'd be the only adults there, we weren't and the majority of people visiting were adults, there were hardly any children which was nice. There's plenty to do to fill up your day. It wasn't overly busy so we didn't have to wait long. The only let down was the food which wasn't very pleasant. On the way out we were given souvenirs for taking part in a survey about our trip and felt our opinions were listened to. I can definitely recommend visiting, even as an adult! ",Disneyland_HongKong
464467603,4,2017-2,Spain,"We visited Hong Kong Disneyland with our 2 year old daughter and loved it.

It is located on an alley near a bakery on Main St. be sure to bring change of clothes cause I saw that most of people get drenched in sweat here. My fav attractions was the grizzly gulch roller coaster, I rode that 6 times! And it's got single rider, it really helped cut the queue! Tommorowland, Mystic Manor, and RC Racer are worth to try as well!",Disneyland_HongKong
464427948,3,2016-6,Singapore,"It can't be the happiest place on earth if it's filled with pushing shoving tourists and crowd. The queues were horrific and there was no management of the queues. The crowd was jumping queue, queuing for a family of 14, and, ill mannered. It made for a negative experience all round. The food was expensive and the restaurant areas were not properly maintained. By that I mean that it was not cleared up fast enough to manage the throngs coming into the restaurants. Needs crowd control, more affordable restaurants with ample seating and more expansive menus. ",Disneyland_HongKong
464390108,4,2016-11,Hong Kong,"One of the company's parks, it has many attractions similar to other Disney parks. The name, however, boosts the entrance ticket cost to high levels. Nightly fireworks display at 8 pm. Easy access by car or MTR train.",Disneyland_HongKong

464275471,4,2017-3,Indonesia,"Hong Kong Disneyland is considered small among other Disneyland. The bright side is you will only need a day to conquer all the attractions.Since mainland tourists of China also opted HK for a getaway, this place kinda packed and crowded even in a casual weekday. So I suggest everyone who plans to visit to start as early as you can.Oh the last, the price of meals and snacks here slightly cheaper compare to other Disney parks. ",Disneyland_HongKong
464168930,4,2017-2,Thailand,"I went there almost the end of February 2017. Unfortunately, the weather isn't on my side, it was cloudy and windy (extra windy with Disneyland right near the seacoast). It took me 40 45 minutes by MTR to go to Disneyland (can be shorter or longer depending on what station is near you, mine is Yau Ma Tei station). I arrived around noon on a Friday, not many people yet (becomes crowded around 3 4PM). It is best to take the Disneyland train if you come in the morning so as you can see the whole park and know which you want to go first. For me, I went from right and circle my way around (my last ride being Grizzly ride). Oh, and I bought an online ticket for one day   plus one meal (589 HKD) from selected restaurant (cheaper than buying at the park). During the day, there will be several recognizable Disney mascots (mickey minney; donald d; Elsa; etc) going to different spots to take pictures). For those planning to collect them all, plan well! You can end up waiting 1.5 hours (seems longer with the cold wind) just to take a pic with one mascot. Ask the staff around the park when and where the mascots will be.As for the rides, there are several to choose from, my favs are Grizzly and Star Wars (all coasters!). You can bring a bottle of water in but doesn't allow food. Eat before entering as the price is quite high.One whole day should be enough to cover most of the rides and activities and parades and fireworks (and by whole day I mean from opening until closing) but two is preferable so as to not get too exhausted (lots of walking!).",Disneyland_HongKong
464065619,4,2016-11,United States,"Everything you would expect from a Disney theme park. The mark is on the smaller side but everything is new and maintained. The best part is the private train to the park, very easy and accessible.",Disneyland_HongKong

Ticket was very expensive, but still felt good value gor the money. Visited on Friday from 1 to 8 pm. Rides were fun for both 4 and 9 y old, lines were'nt too bad, ranging from 5 to 25 min for a few, maybe the cold weather held away the crowds. Even the fast food was edible. If in Hong Kong, would definitely visit again. try to get there by opening and do not leave the shopping for the last hour when the shops are like an ant nest.",Disneyland_HongKong
463931489,4,2017-2,Singapore,First came here more than 13 yrs ago and it was packed like sardine but this time round it was much more easier to queue for the rides. average queue for the rides was 25 min on a weekday so there was no need to buy express pass. Easily accessible by MTR but distance might be a bit far. Would be best to stay 1 night here if travelling with young kids.,Disneyland_HongKong
463929493,5,2016-4,Hong Kong,"HK disneyland is a full day activity and suitable for all ages. If you like the rides, try Space Mountain. If you are an elderly, try the ride called Around the World. Mickey's Philhar Magic is a very good show and so is the parade. If you like fireworks then you should stay till the evening and watch the fireworks. The water splash ride is a lot of fun too. To get there take the Tung Chung (yellow) line MTR to Sunny Bay and the Disneyland train from there. Start early to avoid long queues and enjoy without much crowd. There are varoius restaurants and the one in adventureland also offers a vegetarian set which is filling and good.",Disneyland_HongKong
463834967,4,2016-4,Hong Kong,"If you are a senior, age 65 or over, you can get admission to Disney Hong Kong for about $10.00 U.S. It is not all for children and teens, and there are many good restaurants also in the complex. The cable ride itself is worth it, and shows all the amusements and theatre's from a bird's eye view. The Theatre itself is worth it also, comes with vibrating seats, mist for rain, wind, so it is a real involved movie theatre. Have fun",Disneyland_HongKong

463640052,3,2017-2,United States,"But realize that this is one of the smallest Disney parks and it didn't have too much to offer.

The queue to take a picture with Mickey and Minnie is very long. Also some attractions like star war and iron man. You can download their apps to see the waiting hour and timing.

462827246,5,2017-1,Singapore,"First answering some typical questions traveler's may have:1. Should you visit or not? Definitely Yes, if you have not seen any Disneyland before!2. How much time to devote? We did in a day with few misses, 2 days are suggested if you dont want to miss anything.3. Tickets? Better buy online, why stand in queue.4. Tip: Visit before you see Ocean Park.5. Are there rides for adults or is it kids only park? There are rides which adults can enjoy. RC Racer is only one for adults to give adrenaline rush. But still, it is a must, it is a different world.6. Food? Plenty of options for Non veg. For veggie found corn and few other stuff, nothing as a proper meals. You can carry dry snacks, fruits. We carried sandwiches and were asked to dump it at the entrance.Disneyland was one of the attractions we were looking forward to. Traveling by MTR is best option. Reach Sunny Bay MTR from your start point. From Sunny Bay there is another train that takes to Disneyland. This train is customized to have statues of characters inside it, windows are Mickey Mouse shaped.Once we reached there, we took the map and planned our stops. Meet characters on the way, there may be queue but do that. You wont find characters anywhere else. As per my 3.5 years old son,  meeting characters  was the best part of Disneyland.If you are planning to spend one day then you can skip   Jungle River Cruise section, not a must.Dumbo the elephant was surprising hot favorite. Cinderella Carousel is nice, Slinky Dog Spin was colourful and enjoyable for a 3 yrs old. We did most of the activities on the way. There is a 3D show too.The one thing which I personally liked the most and would recommend not to miss is 'Mickey and the Wondrous Book' show. There are show timings that you need to check in advance.Overall fun, lots of wonderful things to experience, amazing toy shops, souvenir shops and lot more tiring too!",Disneyland_HongKong
462731467,5,2016-3,India,Being a 90's kid I grew up watching cartoon network and Disney as we all know gave us the most of the great cartoon characters.

Smaller than Ocean Park, but everything is like being put just in their right place and function. You should stay until closing time to watch their night time show and the fireworks party. I didn't finish the show because need to catch up the dinner reservation in the Enchanted Garden restaurant at the Disney Hotel. Buffet is really expensive, but worth the price for its spectacular extensive menu and dessert. Heaven for the sweet tooth. And the best of all, Mickey, Minnie, Duffie, Pluto, will come to take a picture with you. You can opt for the photo pass for unlimited online pics (around HKD 400) or they will offer you to take pictures with your phone. It was a memorable experience.",Disneyland_HongKong

462018089,3,2017-2,United States,"I knew the park was smaller than the average Disney property, but was surprised at just how small it was. Also, it was disappointing that two rides were closed for maintenance (although I certainly appreciate that they are maintained!) I went with my boyfriend on a Thursday. Thankfully because the lines were pretty long and I can't imagine what they'd be like on a weekend. Even though they were long, they did go by quickly.The Ironman 4 D  ride  was great, as was the mine car rollercoaster. The jungle ride was silly and boring. We also took a ride thru the Magic Manor (I think that's the name) and it was cute. We did the tea cups and the parachute ride.As is typical with Disney, very expensive, but there were a lot of restaurants to choose from. I do wish there were more varieties of snacks throughout the park. It was very clean and there were a lot of employees. Everyone spoke English which was helpful and not expected.",Disneyland_HongKong
461991689,4,2017-2,Italy,Hong Kong Disneyland is worth going to if you are going to be in Hong Kong for an extended trip and you are with your family. Make sure you check out which rides will be closed when planning your visit! A ton of (much needed) renovations are happening.,Disneyland_HongKong
461934564,5,2017-2,Philippines,"Disneyland is truly one magical place! Be sure to make an itinerary if you wish to try most of the attractions. Tip: Avoid as much as possible having photo op with Mickey or any mascot along Main St. upon opening time (instead, better to schedule this After you've finished all your favorite rides.) Head straight to TomorrowLand first, as this is where long queues really build up.Never ever miss RC Racer and the Big Grizzly Mountain roller coaster, esp. for thrill ride seekers! For the shows, don't miss Mickey and the Fairy Tale Book and Mickey's Philharmagic :) ",Disneyland_HongKong

461859239,5,2016-3,Hong Kong,"Fantastic place for Caucasians to experience Disney with an oriental flavour. Why bother coming to HK to experience the same Western culture? Think Chinese Mickey, Chinderella and other characters. As a result, most of the mainlanders have shifted their attention to destroy and defecate the Disney in Shanghai leaving some peace and tranquility in Disney HK. For the price you pay, you queue a lot less compared to elsewhere. For those who use USD, there is an incentive to go as HKD is pegged to USD so you wont find yourself paying more than as a result of currency fluctuation.",Disneyland_HongKong
461742296,4,2017-1,United Kingdom,"Very enjoyable day at Hong Kong Disney, it cost aprrox   65 for the one day pass, the fireworks were excellent at the end of the day, we did get around the whole park in a day which indicates it is quite small, but all in all well worth it!!",Disneyland_HongKong
461616127,3,2017-2,India,"This was the second time we visited the park and I didn't realise how small it was until we got here. That may be a good thing if you only have a day and have small children, so you don't have to walk much. We were here for three days and it was bit too much time with too little to do. Also, the disappointment is probably more because we visited Paris Disneyland last year and Tokyo the year before, so in comparison, Hong Kong Disneyland pales. However, we didn't even need any fastpasses for any of the attractions as the rides weren't very crowded with all wait times less than 20 mins. We also caught the Lion King three times and the kids did they favourite rides numerous times. We didn't even use the priority pass we had for the iron man experience as the wait time was under 15 minutes. There aren't many thrill rides other than runaway minecart as hyperspace mountain is under refurbishment. If this is the first park you'll be visiting, then go for it. But if you've been to other parks around the world, you might end up disappointed. ",Disneyland_HongKong

So just flash your REGULAR Disneyland Entry ticket across the vending machine and you shall get a ticket mentioning what time to come back for the ride. This helps you save lots and lots of time and you feel like a king or queen going through the Fast Track Lane whilst others stand in queue awaiting their turn.If planning for 2 day visit, I suggest you go early and come back early before 6.00PM on first day to avoid heavy rush and for second day can reach by 12.00PM noon and stay till end to witness Disney Parade and Fireworks.",Disneyland_HongKong

461334873,2,2017-2,Singapore,"A pretty small Disneyland theme park when compared to the rest around the world. The rides and facilities were not bad despite being on a smaller scale. The younger staff were full of energy and passion, which you could associate with in a Disney park. However, the good things stop there. There were quite a number of issues which could inconvenience your experiences at the park:1. Service from the older staff in supervisory positions are often a let down. They generally appeared to be cold and curt, displaying lack of professionalism and enthusiasm of those younger staff. For example, there was one supervisor (in white) at the Royal Banquet Hall who raised his voice and was pretty rude in his reply when approached. 2. Number of food options curtailed with several restaurants closed.3. A number of rides and facilities were also closed during the visits. 4. Numerous mistakes at shows such as Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. For example, singing was not in sync with the music and often out of tune. Dancing was not in sync as well. Overall, the experience at the theme park was marred by the unfortunate incidents. ",Disneyland_HongKong

But all the rides attractions lines weren't that long, and I got into each attraction within 50 minutes.By the way, food, beverages, souvenirs are too expensive.

461127969,3,2017-2,United Kingdom,"As HUGE Disney fans, this was one of the biggest draws in visiting Hong Kong. Unfortunately the park just seemed to be missing the magical Disney atmosphere of most Disney Parks. The castle is far too small (but I believe there are plans for it being improved), there is no area for shows infront of it. The cast members were not as happy and bubbily as with other parks. The park has all the traditional areas and the rides are whole family friendly. We also booked a Private Tour through the park website which was amazing. Dani, our host, spoke fantastic English and was able to restore that Disney feeling that had been missing. The private tour makes you feel like a rockstar as you get to queue jump on most of the rides and get reserved seating in shows. Would definitely recommend anyone to do this.",Disneyland_HongKong
461123271,5,2017-2,Hong Kong,"Lots of reviews below mention how small it is in comparison to the parks in Florida. That's true but taken on its own terms, this park is great fun. We spent nearly 7 hours here and did not see everything so I think that's big enough for a day trip! (In fact, its compact size can be a positive in getting around between rides and zones, which takes no time at all.) Several rides and attractions were genuinely top class and we were there as adults without kids...all of whom in the park seemed to be having the best time of their lives, particularly when the parade went past! The new Iron Man ride is awesome, especially as it's HK specific; the Lion King show is very impressive; Hyperspace Mountain is a wonderful example of how to update a ride to make it relevant after years and years. The racing car ride in the Toy Story zone and the runaway mining cart are also very fun, with short queues. ON TOP OF THAT, the western 'Coca Cola Cafe' on Main Street serves very good food. Yes, it's expensive but my wagyu beef burger was the second best I've had since moving here (second only to Butchers Club). It was that good.

The line up for photo with Mickey and Minnie at 2:34 minutes, well nice but not that nice..

It was great, brother says smaller than the original US version but I did not care. A large amount of walking required but waiting times were very short on most rides and attractions. If you have grandchildren as I do, not a cheap place to buy gifts but then again it is a holiday. Took a tour that supplied pick up and return to hotel, much easier than having to get yourself there and home but that can be done via the MTR if you prefer. Fireworks are set off about 8.30pm, depending on the sunset of course so it makes it a very long day from when the park opens at 10am.

My personal favorites were the High Space Mountain, Grizzly Gulch, RC racer and the newest attraction; IronMan experience.We also enjoyed the parade and really had a great time taking pictures and strolling around.

458403607,5,2016-11,Philippines,"You can ultimately enjoy HK Disneyland in 1 day! Providing you come really early to avoid long lines in popular rides.Try these rides first: Space Mountain, Grizzly, and Adventures of Pooh. I know Adventures of Pooh sounds like a ride for kids only, but the lights and effects are pretty neat and magical! A soft ride, but the effects are really eye candy! Some restaurants were not opened when we visited. Better check out Hong kong Disneyland's website to see which restaurants are not opened and the schedule of shows for the day you will visit. The schedule will be available a week before your visit date.HK Disneyland's meals are pretty expensive. Ranging from HKD 99 to 200. I recommend getting a meal voucher on klook.com for a sweet deal. We used our meal voucher on an expensive meal and saved around PHP 200 .Churros and grilled squid are great! Ice Cream bars are okay. They taste normal. Popcorn was very sweet.The Parades are a must see! To get a better location, find a spot and stay there an hour before parade starts. :DFor those suffering from vertigo, Space mountain might be a little too much. But if you really want to try it out, avoid having a full stomach. You will get dizzy because the ride is poorly lit. I got dizzy and was on the verge of puking, so I avoided any rough rides for an hour or 2. You can go for the slow rides like the adventure of pooh and it's a small world. Eat something.

In my case, I was happy that the daughter was quite happy and excited but what was even more surprising in retrospect was that my wife remembered it very fondly and maybe even enjoyed it even more than my daughter, and hence the title.The rides are all included in the price, and there are quite a few of them all good for the kids for sure and very few that adults may have fun too! It is advisable that you carry your own food as it's expensive inside the park. Also, carry umbrellas and be ready for a long and tiring day as it's quite expansive. There's the option of priority pass that you can choose on select slides which is really good and must be explored.",Disneyland_HongKong

458197215,5,2016-10,India,We took two day ticket from klook   and let me tell you it's never enough.. We went during Halloween   time so everything was decked up Halloween style Day 1 was a bit hectic with the late check in and long flight yet we managed to squeeze in few attraction leaving plays and parade for the next day. All the attractions were so much fun the kids loved it and then coming to parades disneyland night time   Halloween theme villan nights out   parade was simply magical!   We managed to catch up with festival of the lion king show which was   spectacular. We were not so lucky with meet and greet disney characters.. We did manage to get few snaps of various disney   characters   but missed quite a few tooo... The disneyland park did serve halal food so dining was pleasant experience. We booked our ticket through klook which included a voucher food voucher   so incase you are looking for halal restaurant you can visit Hk disneyland website for further detail on designated halal eatery anyway we ended our disney journey with a magical extravagant show of fireworks its was a perfect end to our magical journey Overall..

So always put your sports shoes on for Disneyland as you have to walk a lot but in a fruitful way. Highly recommended!!!!!!",Disneyland_HongKong
457765689,4,2016-3,Vietnam,"by no means cheap, but great entertainment for the young and young at heart. Do not bother to eat the crappy fast food in the park it is dismal, but the hotel food was very good. Will go again",Disneyland_HongKong
457751196,4,2017-2,Philippines,Been to almost all Disneyland Parks in the world so expecting almost the same experience as the other parks. HK Disneyland has an Asian feel to it though. We waited for the Disney character parade and the fireworks at night.. didnt disappoint.,Disneyland_HongKong
457716578,4,2017-2,China,"Perfect family day out. For thrill seekers this is not the park for you as the more adventurous rides are still quite tame. It's not a huge park, which makes it easy to navigate. The shows and parades are everything you expect of Disney and check you map for the locations of characters for the memorable photograph.Food here is typically overpriced and catered to local tastes.",Disneyland_HongKong
457696129,5,2017-2,Australia,Great for the whole family. Easy to get around. A variety of places to eat for any budget. The disney parade was a great highlight that was missing from the L.A. disneyland. The disney characters are out all day for lots of photo opportunities.,Disneyland_HongKong
457605654,2,2017-1,Philippines,"Having been to Disneyland in California and Disney World in Florida, this place is too small that you wouldn't need a day to see everything. The day and night parades were too short that watching them became a waste of time. Unless this is the first Disneyland that you will visit, going here would be futile.",Disneyland_HongKong
457507244,4,2017-1,United States,"Decided to take a trip to Hong Kong before Chinese New Year and took the kids to HK Disney. Kind of odd because we live about 10 minutes away from the original Disney in Anaheim. First impression, it felt like Disneyland. The decorations, layout, feel and employees all made it feel like Disney. The main difference was the crowd. We arrived early so didn't have to fight as much of a crowd. We took the boys on a few rides early, and was even able to get on the new Iron Man ride with minimal wait. It felt like there were more rides suited for young kids and less extreme rides, but since we went with younger kids, it was fun. We watched a few shows and felt that the shows were actually better in HK Disney than the Anaheim one. The performance wasn't necessarily better, but the overall compilation was better. Seeing that the tickets were cheaper than the US Disney and they had more food selections, the overall experience was not disappointing. Although, I did have to tell some guy off for not being able to stand in line correctly, and the best part was his lame excuse. But that didn't ruin our family time. ",Disneyland_HongKong
457488884,4,2016-7,United Arab Emirates,"Well, it's Disney land ! Great place with lots and lots of activities for kids and adults.  But take care of your belongings, theft is quite common.

457478747,5,2016-12,China,"Every time we went to Hongkong, we always visit this place at least for 2 days! Hahaha It's kinda small compare to Tokyo and Shanghai but! I would recommend for the first time people visit Disney, this place is perfect for you... because wait time is not crazy, so at least on one day you can ride everything's at least once.My last visit, they open new area for iron man!! And we got lucky they open for public on the day so we can try to ride! The iron man ride was awesome!!Lilbit tips for you... you should try the Mickey magic show ( you should try to go at least 45 30mnt before the show since the show is soo famous! And it's child friendly and awesome show) space mountain and iron man show.I would miss this place and will definitely back again!",Disneyland_HongKong

But for evening parade, it will be start from the other direction, from train to castle.Its exhausting day but really fun ",Disneyland_HongKong
457068506,5,2017-2,Australia,We have planed to visit Hong Kong primary to visit the Disneyland. The price was acceptable as we booked online and this offered us to pass the long ticket lanes. The kids enjoyed the park a lot as well as we. The staffs were very friendly and helpful. The was crowded in some games but we have chosen to play the games with waiting of less than 30 minutes. We were not able to see the whole parts of the park. Must be visited.,Disneyland_HongKong
457048840,4,2017-1,Philippines,We arrived shortly after the opening and the first thing we did when we entered the park was fall in line for a picture with Mickey and Minnie of course! We went there on a weekday so it was not that crowded but the waiting time went as high as 40min. For a picture with Mickey and Minnie we had to wait in line for ~40min. The popular rides also had 30 40min waiting time. One day won't be enough so I recommend getting the 2 day ticket.,Disneyland_HongKong
457031885,4,2017-1,United States,"So, it is a very small Disney and people tell you that it can be accomplished in 4 5 hours. That could be true if you did not have to spend an hours in line for Dumbo ride, or to take pictures with the characters. I think if you get there first thing in the morning, before the gates open, it would probably allow you to do more. After 1PM, there is a long line for everything during weekends, or Chinese New Year. We got there at noon, and by then, the crowds were there. Also, despite how amazingly orderly everything in Hong Kong can be, one thing that the locals (and maybe mainland China visitors) are chaotic about is cutting in lines and just generally shoving their way around. It can get quite annoying. Many people spend a lot of time in the shops, it seems. What a great business to charge a huge entrance fee and then make the easiest place be the shops, where you spend even more. The Fireworks are really nice as advertised. Take the MTR to and from, but be prepared for huge crowds and being sandwiched in the train. It is like taking the public transportation after a sports even lets out.",Disneyland_HongKong
456879595,4,2017-2,Australia,"We arrived an hour before opening and were one of the first ones in the gate. We went on most rides straight away without any waiting. By midday most rides had in between 20 to 50 minute wait times. I think it was also in our favour that we went on a Thursday and not the weekend. This is a small Disneyland compared to the ones in the U.S and would be perfect to take young children. We walked the park 3 times around and went on most rides as well as having lunch and we left at 4pm. Getting to Disneyland was very easy by the mtr. We caught the train from Jordan to Lai king, Lai king to sunny bay then the Disneyland train.",Disneyland_HongKong

456718339,4,2017-1,Canada,"We actually stayed at the Disneyland hotel the 3 days we went into the park. they have a good transportation system to the park, the only downside is that it's a long walk to the entrance. I would suggest that they have additional transportation from the transportation hub to the gates, even if they charge. After all, there is nothing free at Disney.The staff greeting you are very friendly and courteous, despite the fact that they have to deal with unruly mainlander crowds.Surprisingly, almost all the staff had pin lanyards to trade pins with, which mainlanders don't know about yet, so bring pins to trade. I was told by a friend that it is only because it was CNY and they had to all show the pins due to higher ranking bosses making sure that they looked good during this Festive season.The parades are well organized and professional. access to characters can test your patience, as some. lineups, specially for Mickey and Minnie were running a couple of hours long. Best to check for times with their staff and get there early.The restaurants were many but be prepared to pay lots for little food as the norm at Disney parks.The stores were full of merchandise and no shortage of buyers.Their Ironman experience was new, but just a conversion of the Star Wars experience at other parks.They are opening a 3rd hotel, so no doubt the park will get much busier. A note if you are going around CNY, go on the first day of CNY. no crowds at all",Disneyland_HongKong
456685669,5,2016-10,India,One of the best attractions in hong kong. Best ride is the mystic manor so make sure you don't miss it. Loved the lion king show.

This place tough suitable mostly for kids anyway adults can also enjoy some excitments. I love the theathers, parks, small ridings as well as water cruising. Tarzan tree house is good, it provide views from the top over the rivers and parks. Grizzly mine was exciting and thrill (at least for me). Your kids probably will LOOOVE the toy story sections. Simba theather performance is truly not too miss. Overall, I enjoy my moments here, excitement without being overly exhousted :)",Disneyland_HongKong

It was my sons bday and most of crew wished him happy birthday. He was truly elated with this gesture. Not to miss is the Jedi training, lion king show and the wondrous book show.

455675907,4,2017-1,United States,"We enjoyed Disneyland Hong Kong. It is a fairly small park, but easy to navigate through in just a day, no need for multiple days. T it is easy to get to using the MRT. Disney line is clearly marked in all the stations (the pink line), and the train is very Disney oriented. It had memorabilia and Mickey hand holds   lots of fun for the kids to see. The rides were fun. Fast passes are only available for three rides: Marvel Experience, Hyperspace Tours, and The Winnie the Pooh ride. If you don't like  Asian inspired American Food , bring your own lunch. The Lion King show was awesome, but the crowd management is awful   only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five. They line you up to put you in groups, then it is a mad dash to grab a seat. Felt like Walmart on Black Friday. Get there early to be in the front to avoid the pushing and shoving. It needs to be more organized, but again, the show was great. Lines weren't too bad, and we went on Chinese New Year. They do a good job of letting you know what's happening around the park. Most employers speak English enough to help if needed. Prices for souvenirs and merchandise is comparable to US parks. They will let you pay with either USD or HKD, your receipt shows you both prices. Just be aware they are offering a lower conversion fee ( .4% I think). They do offer many  freebies  and deals with purchase that seemed to be a good deal. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at Disneyland Hong Kong. ",Disneyland_HongKong
455551136,3,2017-1,Germany,"One day here should be enough to get to see what you would like to see.Entry is about 70 Euros. You can take the MRT   about 6 stops from HK station.Get your Fast Track Passes as soon as you enter. Seems you cant take cans of drinks inside, but we seem to have been ok with plastic bottles.Download the app before you go   that was a huge help, as you can navigate around the park and the best feature was that you could see how long the actual wait time is for the individual rides.Avoid the hot dogs   probably the worst in Hong Kong, possibly in the whole of South East Asia.

If you've never been to any other Disneyland park you will likely be in awe and amazement of all the fun and wonder... But if you have been to another Disneyland park before, you won't love it as much. Don't get me wrong   it's awesome...but it's a lot smaller than most other Disneyland parks. The scenery is beautiful (there's mountainous hills behind the park which offer a really nice backdrop), and it does have some of the standard Disneyland rides (Space Mountain, the Tea Cups, It's A Small World).

For us we got the whole bus rented ,just for us ,going to Disneyland and it so much fun! We started the fun at 1030, be sure to get your ticket online, or purchased it already because queue is Super Long, for us as I stated earlier everything is arranged by the hotel, so everything is provided except for the ride home, it is either take the train or bus. It was really fun that we have tried all of the rides and attractions on this place, and be sure to take the map with you, actually we don't know their two versions of the map, we actually have the Chinese one, so all day we are actually reading the Chinese version, ( we know a little bit of Chinese but can't understand some) that's why try to find the English version which is provided in front after you enter the place. Their are food stores inside a bit pricey but I think if your hungry their nothing much you can do. At the end of the day is a fireworks and parade of the stars, try to go to the center for a better look for the fireworks and near to castle for the parade.they will start 7 pm for the parade then 8 pm for the fireworks.

The afternoon and night parades are fantastic   well worth getting a spot by main street about 30mins prior to the start time. The only criticism is the food. It is terrible. Nothing health at all but with no competition around, I guess they can do what they want. Take food if you can; we stayed at the Hollywood Disney Hotel so had no choice (and there food there is not any better and way overpriced).",Disneyland_HongKong
455237345,5,2016-10,United States,"As a long time lover of Disney, I knew I had to visit Disneyland when I started planning my trip to Hong Kong. I've only been to the two in the US, so this was a very different experience but definitely one that I would highly recommend for anyone who enjoys exploring Disney parks. I thought the admission price was reasonable despite the park being so small, at least compared to the prices in the US. My husband and I visited on a Tuesday and the park was completely empty, we didn't wait more than 5 minutes for any ride and on most of them we walked right on without a wait at all. That being said, I really wanted a picture with Mickey and Minnie (they were dressed for Halloween!) but the line was gigantic so I skipped it, it was the only place a ton of people seemed to be congregating. We arrived right as the park opened and a number of the rides and sections of the park were still closed off for another half hour or so which I thought was odd, but we took that time to walk around and figure out where everything was. Since we got through the rides we wanted to do so quickly we only stayed for about a half a day but that was perfect for us. I was sad to see that the facade of It's A Small World was under construction so it was covered in tarps, but at the same time I realize that Disney is always updating and freshening the rides up, so it is usually to be expected. The real struggle we faced was that the rides seemed to be built for smaller passengers, my husband is 6'4  and was barely squeezing into some of the cars, the most difficult ride of all was Space Mountain. They put him in, what they said, the seat with the most leg room and we still almost had to give up and get off because he couldn't squeeze his knees in. He did end up wiggling in at the last second but was extremely uncomfortable and had a scraped knee by the time we got off. Other than that detail, the rides were great! We especially enjoyed the ones that are exclusive to HK, such as Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Manor (this is almost the equivalent of the Haunted Mansion). Since we visited during Halloween time there was a haunted house type of attraction but we were a little puzzled as to what was going on. There were live actors but no one was speaking English so we were just sort of following the crowd and trying to figure out the story line.. everyone who understood the actors seemed to be really scared though! All in all it was a great experience, definitely a must do for the Disney lovers out there. If you can, try to go early to mid week and get there for the park opening, you'll easily have a good view of the ribbon cutting which is fun to watch and it gets a little more crowded as the day goes on.",Disneyland_HongKong
455099287,5,2017-1,Norway,"My 6 year old daughter and 8 year old niece had a blast exploring the park together. It was heaven for them seeing their favorite Disney characters, trying the rides, and being so happy and excited just by being there. Since she is 115cm, my daughter got to try the Grizzly mulch runaway mine cars, which is the highlight of the trip for her    the ride is super exciting and made her feel like a  big girl . She was also amazed by the Lion King performance and has become emotional about the play. Like I said, just being there gives you that happy and excited energy. The park is relatively small and is very good for groups with small kids, maybe a bigger park would be overwhelming kids her age. it was a long day but I dont think we were ever tired.

454645750,5,2017-1,Australia,We are an older couple but we thoroughly enjoyed Disneyland. It is smaller and does not have as many rides but it is not so busy either. We had very short (about 5 minutes) wait to get on rides. We arrived as it opened and the Disney characters are on the Main Street to see. Lots of shops to look in and some good shows to watch. The parade was very entertaining.,Disneyland_HongKong
454603668,4,2016-12,Philippines,"Disneyland is indeed the happiest place on Earth. It is located at Lantau Island, Outlying Islands. Disneyland is truly The Happiest Place on Earth. It is where our childhood princes, princesses and other fairy tale creatures come to life.",Disneyland_HongKong
454391249,5,2017-1,United States,We have been before.... so 5 STARS... we are returning. We stay at the hotel at the airport so there is shuttle to take us to the park. We have also taken the subway to the park. Both very easy. Go early   not as many people. We had to leave mid afternoon and many people still coming in. Right now January 2017 they are refurbishing Small World. Went on the new Iron Man ride twice! Be sure to get fast past tickets to the bigger events. They don't have a Haunted House but Mystic Mansion and it is different and fun. Went twice! This is not as big as the parks in the USA but still a fun day out. ,Disneyland_HongKong
454226822,3,2017-1,Australia,"Disneyland was never going to be my cup of tea. I got a good deal on tickets from Klook, which lessened the pain somewhat. But it is still prohibitively expensive, especially when you add in transport and overpriced food and souvenirs. Even on a relatively quiet mid week day it was crowded and most of the rides had 10 30 minute waits. The kids maintained their enthusiasm reasonably well and perhaps there is benefit in teaching patience. We stayed for the best part of a day but only saw about a third of the park. If you are a Disney enthusiast, I would suggest two full days, especially if you are there during a busy time. In the interests of balance, I asked the kids for a different perspective. This is how it looked to the people that really matter :From my four year old son: My favourite part was hugging Mickey and Minnie and the Ding Dong train (Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad). My next favourite was the Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride and the horsey ride (Cinderella Carousel). I even liked the new train that took us there (Disneyland MTR line). The dog one (Slinky Dog Spin ride in Toy Story land) was very scary. Eight year old daughter had a similar perspective: The visit to Disneyland was special for me because there is no Disneyland in Sydney where I live. I have never been to any Disneyland except this one in Hong Kong. I liked the Dumbo merry go round because you can steer it up and down. I also liked the Cinderella horse merry go round. I got on a big white horse that looked angry and fast. Then we watched the Disney characters go in a parade. The only thing I disliked was having to wait in line. ",Disneyland_HongKong
454184230,5,2017-1,India,"One of the best place in Hong Kong to spend a day however if you have been to other Disneyland you might find this one very compact but definitely worth visiting however I come from India and I have not seen other Disney so it was great experience for me and my mother. If you are Asia and have not been to other Disneyland I am sure you will love it.Ticketing: Cost of tickets on Disney Land counter is for HK$589, if you buy it from any 7 11 it would cost you the same, I went to ticketing counter to see if they have got any promotional offer but there was not anything offer, you I installed  KLOOK  application and bought tickets for HK$497.Food: Food inside is dam expensive, half corn HK$100, Piece of Chicken HK$100 and if you are thinking of having meal it will cost you about HK$168 300 depend where and what you eat. I would advise you to buy the food coupon from Main Entrance Ticket Booth which cost HK$238 includes (Lunch   Dinner   Snacks) but there will be long queue so it is best to buy it from    KLOOK    for HK$80 for a decent size meal.Tips: There are many sites where it is stated they do not allow you to carry selfie stick so I did not carry it however its allowed carrying selfie stick everywhere except shows, also they allow you to carry water, biscuits, snacks inside but not meal so it makes sense to carry something specially if you are on a budget. You need to reach for all shows minimum 30 minutes prior to show time to be able to get seat, we ended up missing Mickey show because it was houseful.Park and show timings: Park Hours 10:00 AM to 8:00 PMDisney Paint the Night Parade 6:45 PMAfternoon of Fantasy Parade 3:00 PMFireworks Main Street: 7:45 PMLion King Show: 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM, 4:30 PM, 6:00 PMJedi Training: Trials of the Temple Tomorrow land 11:30 AM, 12:45 PM, 2:00 PM, 3:30 PM, 4:45 PM, 6:00 PM, 7:30 PM (You can skip this one, its more for toddlers) Mickey and the Wondrous Book 11:15 AM, 12:30 PM, 2:00 PM, 4:30 PM, 6:00 PM, 7:15 PM",Disneyland_HongKong

Though it was chilly we had the best weather that day and the place looked magical :) The ticketing and the entrance was hassle free and faster than expected. We didn't like much of the foods available at the resort as it was really bland and tasteless. There was a lot of activities to choose from and thought the rides were short it was ok as the wait for the rides were not long either. We got to see the Flights of Fantasy from the front row and it was pretty cool. Recommend waiting for the night light show. Definitely worth a visit if you are in HK :)",Disneyland_HongKong

We made a mistake coming here for the day; I hear Ocean Park is better value. This is just another Disney Park with little other than the words 'Hong Kong' making different to any other Disney Park. If you're travelling from Europe or USA and have been to another Disney Park already then give this one a miss; if you really want to go, only allow 5 hours   thats enough.",Disneyland_HongKong

We bought ticket via klook online which save us time from queuing up. Food are not allowed so we have to prepare some money to buy food. Expect 30 60 min time to queue up for each game. We went there at 12 pm to avoid the crowd. Its convenient to travel with mtr interchange.

453580490,4,2017-1,Australia,We enjoyed the experience of Disneyland Hong Kong but found it catered more to our 5 year old more than our teenagers. It seems to be more suited for younger children rather than EuroDisney which we found better for older kids and adults. Definitely worth checking out if you have a day to spare and haven't been to Disneyland before. Fireworks when the park closes were lovely but packed and I'd suggest if you want to buy things from the stores to do it earlier in the day as it's crowded and crazy at the end!,Disneyland_HongKong
453535218,4,2017-1,Australia,Definitely worth a visit and is easily accessible via the MTR. If you have visited any of the other Disney parks then you will probably find this one a little small.

453494029,5,2016-12,Australia,"This is the third Disneyland I've been to and overall the experience is pretty much the same. This site is smaller and therefore not as many rides so the queues are longer. Also, being in Hong Kong expect to have people trying to not obey queue rules, like lining up. You just have to tell them that there is a line for a reason and they back off. This culture simply doesn't understand waiting your turn.There are small differences, like the food has a slight Asian tint but that is ok we enjoyed that. We skipped the shows and did all the rides and managed to get through everything in a day, but we could have spent another day easily.Getting there is simple on the MTR.",Disneyland_HongKong

The superb MTR underground railway, is a great and eay way yo get to the doorstep of the park. The staff seems to try hard to make it a real Disney Park. Now the bad, it is small the whole park is less than the smallest area in the Florida park. Most of the rides and things from the US parks will not be here. Look for 1 or 2 rides per area. The food is not like normal Disney food, more like poor quality street food. The items available in the stops is limited and double what the cost was in America the last time I was at the park. It is Hong Kong with lots of tourist so long lines. The bottom line if you are here living in Asia it is a choice, but don't travel thousands of miles to visit this park it is just not worth it.",Disneyland_HongKong

Phantom Mannor (a updated and less  horror driven  version of the haunted mansion), Grizzly Gulch and Iron Man are all unique and very well done. Space Mountain is excellent here and has a great Star Wars theme applied.

As we were doing 2 days in the park we actually bought a Silver annual pass (this is the same price as 2 single tickets). A silver pass only allows you to visit on weekdays (& even then there are a few other blackout days), but you also can use the pass to get discount of food, drink & merchandise in the park.

Queues were minimal     no more than 10 mins for any ride. We walked around the park in an anti clockwise direction, which brought us to the area for the parade for 3pm. When finding a spot for the parade, you can get a better view if are not on an outside bend on a curve. The left luggage facility was very straightforward and could accommodate our huge cases. It is just to the left before the bag search areas which is just before the ticket desks.

Of course the latest is iron man which is really awesome (has a  free  tour around HK) plus exhibition of good to be true technologies, which kids and teens will love. Expect long queues as usual so plan ahead. If you want to ride as many attractions as possible, be at the site before opening as large crowd usually comes around noon. Suggest to take iron man, hyperspace mountain, lion king, rc racer and runaway mine cars as these where usually the long lines are. Watching parades is a must so suggest to be at the main street prolly 30 mins before the parade starts coz they attract crowd. The ending (fireworks display) is really a must see. This is where you will feel that you are a disney kid. Food: there's limited variety of food and they are really pricey (everything in disney is pricey). Try korean squid .

It was pretty quiet until just after lunch when the place became packed.If you don't mind splitting up, go in the singles line.

452236934,1,2016-12,Hong Kong,"My young daughter loves Hong Kong Disneyland so we went often. We've visited the park for 9 years continuously, and we were their loyal  Magic Access Card Members . But we   ve faced constant and repeated assault by other visitors, mainly from Mainland China. We   ve been punched, finger poked, hit by selfie sticks, pushed, stepped on, verbally abused etc. Each time the staff just watched, stood there motionless, and they took no actions. I've had 10 15 minute shouting arguments with people because they've either aggressively pushed me or my child, at times in  It's A Small World  and also  HyperSpace Mountain  where the arguments echoed loudly, but the staff do not help or call any security ! When I've complained to the staff (inside the  rides  or in their  City Hall ); they refused to collect the details of the attackers and they did not call the police. In fact; they've NEVER called the police when I asked for their help ! They would say to me  It's a nice day why don't you enjoy the park and rides ! . I   ve sent emails to Hong Kong Disneyland on their security in the park but wthout real satisfaction. To force the personal security issue; on Saturday 3 December 2016 I deliberately took some goods in plain sight from the park   s  Emporium Shop  and walked out slowly until I was caught. It took them 15 minutes to catch up with me. I fully cooperated with the security staff, and I told them my reasons for my actions. My reasons being to high light the lack of personal safety and security within the park, and the fact that all of the security are concentrated in the shops to protect Hong Kong Disney's merchandise. When they caught me I was about to walk back to the shop and return the goods. I had NO intention of keeping the goods. In their INTERROGATION ROOM it was a HORRIBLE  Disney  experience. Harsh, nasty, no empathy, no understanding, a situation I found threatening because I was surrounded by three large security men. There was more security than all of the years I   ve been going there. The attending woman security supervisor ( a  Miss A    a name that sounds like a  musical ) did not care about my reasons. She refused to contact any staff to validate my written complaints. I told her whom to contact and which department, and she refused ! She stated it was another department ! She was robotic and bloody minded ! Her words to me were insulting, and dismissive for the reasons of my actions. She stated to me that they had policies and procedures to follow. I replied that her staff did not follow any policies and procedures when I and my daughter were attacked. She was silent on this. She stated Hong Kong Disneyland will charge me for  theft  and the police will escort me to the Lantau Police Station. She stated that I should take my young daughter with me to the police station because I will be there for a long time. I told her that I could not do that because it will SCARE her. She kept. on saying that  I'm an adult and I should reflect on my actions . That goes both ways ! She lacked the humanity and common sense to understand the reasons for my actions, and she wanted my child to spend hours in a police sation with me ! I spent 12 hours in a police station; and I left at 3am in the morning. Economic loss to Hong Kong Disneyland is ZERO (the goods will be returned to them). Moneatary loss to me will be in the TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars in lawyers fee's to avoid a conviction ! And all because I was concerned about personal security and safety in Hong Kong Disneyland ! It   s clear to me that Hong Kong Disneyland ONLY cares about protecting (and selling) its overpriced cheaply produced plastic goods. When I and my daughter were attacked NO security personnel ever arrived, but when anybody takes their goods without paying then there is an army of security. The fact that Hong Kong Disneyland wants to prosecute me for my actions shows the true nature and character of the company. Yes I REGRET my actions; I was wrong to think so highly of  Disney  that they would understand my actions and the reasons for it. So much for a  caring  company. My daughter cried for several hours because I was in a police station, and my wife was immensely worried by Hong Kong Disneyland's actions against me. I was told,  by that woman , that I will be banned from returning for a year. Return there after this PHYSCHOLOGICAL TRAUMATIC  Magical Experience  ?

451555425,4,2017-1,Australia,"An exciting place to be with 2 teenagers. My husband and I enjoyed being 'kids' again. Although we spent the whole day there but didn't get to go on all the rides as we did not have enough time! The shows are fabulous which should not be missed! We were disappointed that the second parade had to be cancelled due to the weather but were lucky enough fireworks for the finale was not. My only 3 negative comments about this place that some staff don't look happy (remember that is this should be the happiest place on earth), the queues to the show were not well organise (everybody was pressed up to each other and when the doors open there was a frantic rush) and announcements in English were so difficult to understand! Nevertheless, overall it was a wonderful family trip!",Disneyland_HongKong
451511971,3,2017-1,United States,"My wife and I made a quick 2 hour visit to the HK Disneyland. The rate for senior 65 and over is $100 HK or about $15 US which is a great price as compared to over $570 HK for a regular adult ticket. The park is considerably smaller than the ones in the U.S. with many the same attractions and layout. We did a quick train ride boarding at Main Street Station and briefly walk through Fantasy Land and Tomorrow Land. We did not try the rides in consideration of our ages. Overall, it was a nice visit but nothing special for us. It was easy to get to the park via MTR to Sunny Bay Station and change to the Disneyland Line (Pink Line).",Disneyland_HongKong
451441051,5,2017-1,Singapore,"No doubt not as great as the other disneylands in terms of thrill factor on the roller coaster rides, but the place was still done up really well with good crowd control. Food is very expensive though, so recommended to pack your own food. A day is enough to finish the entire theme park. Overall a very pleasant experience!",Disneyland_HongKong
451409085,5,2017-1,United States,Disney is always great and this one surely doesn't disappoint. Go for the fun and entertaining atmosphere. The only subpar thing is the food... Why can't Disney improve this?????,Disneyland_HongKong
451403546,4,2017-1,United States,"My wife and I visited this park with our 21 month old daughter and had a great time. The lines were short (no more than 15 20 min) and the park was not crowded. We loved the character meet and greets because there was a short line so we were able to do many of them. We stayed for 2 days but could have done everything in 1 day.Only con is most of the park closes an hour before fireworks. For us, that meant the rides we planned to do were closed at 7 instead of 8. This was not communicated well to us but there were signs and warnings (that we did not see on the guide map). ",Disneyland_HongKong
451373797,5,2016-10,India,this is a must see attraction. Mind blowing even if you are not taking kids.  Do not  miss the fireworks which happen post 6 pm that is the best part of the tour.,Disneyland_HongKong

451360966,5,2016-8,Singapore,"The parade and the fireworks is the most awaited higlight. There are limited attractions for adult, adventure land and the star wars ride. Star wars is a new attraction and its a high speed indoor roller coaster. You must try it and repeat it five times!!! The dining areas are not so spacious so if you will visit on a weekend, be ready. Tips: 1. Bring an umbrella if you hate the sun 2. Bring extra shirt coz it's really humid and hot 3. Buy an express ticket if you're visiting on a weekend or else be ready to wait for 2hrs for queue 4. Better visit ocean park if you're traveling as a couple. You will appreciate it though if you're still fond of Mickey and mini mouse! ",Disneyland_HongKong
451342866,3,2016-12,Indonesia,"I love theme park but this disneyland somehow didnt give me that kick. It is a typical disney park but this is a very small park. Do not compare to the one in us. And to me i still prefer disneysea in japan. It is more for the kids and those challenging enough for adults are probably only the toy story and the starwars hyper space mountain which is fun. Also the grizzly bear roller coaster has a twisted surprise which I didn't expect so it was a good experience. I don't get the chance to watch the shows, sad. Because i had to take dad back to the hotel and return again to disney. Anyway we almost tried all the ride in just one day. Oh and the mystic manor is also entertaining. The one which you rode on a boat through the river is also nice to try. Make sure to stay and watch the fireworks. The buzz lightyear is also nice esp for kids. And they have a new iron man, which similar to transformer ride in universal studio singapore, the kids will love this. Overall it is a good park of course but compare to other disney then it is just an average disney park ",Disneyland_HongKong
451340718,4,2016-2,New Zealand,"We had 2 young kids under 5 with us. Queues were long but moved relatively quickly considering the length of them! Staff were friendly & efficient. As the gates opened people sprinted for the most popular rides, I would say head (fast!) to the ride you MOST want to do as the queues got longer as the day progressed, the first 2 rides we did we didnt have to wait for than 3 minutes to get on but when we got to the more popular rides we waited 30  minutes. Food was relatively good, no long waits. The shows were a great way to get away from the swarming crowds & hot weather. We spent 2 days going through, which I would recommend due to the crowds & being able to get your moneys worth on the rides. Plenty for the younger kids to do see. If staying at the Disneyland hotel, be sure to be outside waiting for the complimentary bus early as the crowds for that were incredible!",Disneyland_HongKong

451113245,4,2017-1,India,Disneyland is fun anytime you go. Its even better this time. They have now Iron man experience center and strak expo for iron man lovers. Micky's magic show is a must watch its a 3D show with water n wind being real. The train is again a must go as it gives a full round of the Disneyland. Only problem is food choice is very limited n is very very expensive. Remember to carry ur water bottle as its 6 times the price inside. Shopping is fun. N guys there is this locker service inside which is very safe n convenient just in case you have extra stuff. We had our transfers booked but we took the MTR(metro train) its was very fast n comfortable. Have fun guys be a child again!!!!,Disneyland_HongKong

451100450,4,2017-1,Singapore,"We went there on a Saturday and was half expecting some huge crowds but surprisingly it was manageable. The queues for the rides were within 30 mins and some are just 10 mins. Overall still a very magical place even for the adults.We stayed for the night light up parade and the kids enjoyed themselves. Baby care room was clean, neat and well equipped. I expressed milk there in the nursing room, warmed up the milk with the bottle warmer, used the high chair while I was warming the milk and fed my baby there too. Men are allowed in the baby care room, outside the nursing room. Got a little crowded when the dads, moms and some with grandmas when I was feeding my baby her milk. But still a very comfortable and pleasant place.Do download the app before you go to Disneyland, preferably in your own country. I downloaded mine before the trip and my hubby only did when he got there but had problems with downloading. The app is useful and tells you the waiting time of each ride on the map. As well as the show timings.",Disneyland_HongKong

Also got to see a sneak peek of the new Ironman Experience coming soon. Favorite rides....Hyperspace Mountain, Ironman, Toy Story RC Racer and Parachute Drop, Big Grizzly Mtn Runaway Mine Cars.

It was raining by the time we reached the park. But that did not stop us from enjoying ourselves. Rides like the Big Grizzly Mountain (like Anaheim's Big Thunder Mountain Railroad) and Space Mountain were pluses. Toy Story Parachute Drop was an attraction that we did not see at Dineyland Anaheim and turned out to be thrilling too. All the rides were simply awesome and queues were not that long either.

Only things I really wanted to ride see but missed were the Toy Soldier Parachute Drop (waiting time never dropped below 20mins) and Mickey and the Wondrous Book (we came on time, but they're not letting people in anymore).If you're going to make a priority list, I'd say put Runaway Mine Cars, Hyperspace Mountain, and Astro Blasters on Top. Don't miss Festival of the Lion King and the Paint the Night parade, too.Food is expensive as expected, but you can easily sneak in a bar or two.

We still enjoyed our time. I did find restaurants to not have much variety for vegetarians, which I was really disappointed about. I would've loved a vegetarian burger, but settled for pasta. The fireworks at the end of the night were spectacular, and really ended our long day quite well. I really praise the cast and crew of The Lion King show   they did an amazing show and are exceptionally talented. I also really enjoyed the Tarzan boat ride around the tree house.

450174414,3,2016-12,Hong Kong,"Compared to Tokyo Disneyland which I've been 8 times, this park in HK is lack lustre in terms of scale and more importantly, the feeling of warmth and happiness that it's supposed to bring to visitors.My 3 year old daughter eagerly queued and waited patiently for her turn to take picture with Elsa and Anna at one of the restaurants during lunch time. And she waited once again to speak with them when she realised that she forgot to ask them why they did not come to Singapore (a genuinely innocent question for a young child), during her turn to take photograph. She was only patronisingly acknowledged by the cast members and was ushered away without getting a reply from them. This disappointing response from Disney characters, who are known to be friendly and warm at all times, was actually rather appalling if you ask me. (P.s. The adults were not too impressed with their looks too, given that they were supposed to be pretty princesses.) My poor little girl kept asking me why they did not answer her and wore a sad look on her face for a while, until her next meeting with Donald and Daisy outside the Emporium at around 2pm.This time, she was turned down yet again when she offered M&M candies, which she just purchased from the shop, to them. This was easier to explain to her cos they were working and they did not have a real  mouth piece  to consume food.Overall, the experience at HK Disneyland can be improved if they really want to pride themselves as the happiest place on earth.",Disneyland_HongKong

Good selection of rides and also other attractions but everything easily covered and we did not arrive until lunchtime. Food also very good. I had an excellent lamb curry at Mystic Point .

449804083,5,2016-12,India,"It was my 6 yrs old daughter's dream to meet her favorite Disney stars. To be honest, my HK trip was Disneyland centric alone as places like Dubai have better tourist attractions than HK. We booked Disneyland tickets via Klook a month in advance and availed good discounts!Reaching Disneyland is so very easy... The HK Disneyland is located on the Lantau Island near the airport. You can either take a Disney Resort MTR Line, a taxi, a public bus or a coach. We stayed at Panda hotel and it took less than 45 min for us to reach there.If you are travelling by MTR, change for Disney Resort Line at Sunny Bay Station. This is a direct dedicated line to the Disneyland with a frequency of 4 10 minutes. Bus R33 (to Tuen Mun Railway Station) and R42 (to Tai Wai Railway Station) operate 20 minutes after the fireworks display. In Sundays and public holidays, Bus R33 and R42 run from Tuen Mun and Tai Wai to the Resort Public Transportation Interchange at 09:00, 09:20 and 09:45.The Disney Resort Line is a themed MTR train with Mickey Mouse shaped windows and comfortable sofas. This MTR brings you straight to the Disneyland station from where you can walk up to the entrance counters. The queue starts almost 1 hour before park opening. Your vouchers are converted to regular tickets only through the entrance. Being a small park it can be seen back to front in nearly 5 hours. Wear comfortable shoes as you have to walk a lot and stand in long queues at times. As someone suggested here already, consider going deep into the park to Adventureland or Tomorrowland and then work your way back     you   ll skip the crowds and queues will be shorter. I had clearly read here that visitors head straight to the character meet and greets near the entrance when the gates open and the queues build there up pretty fast... However with a 6 year old dying to meet her favorite characters i too didnt have a choice but to add to the queue :) Light snacks were allowed without any fuss inside the park. The staff was very helpful and courteous. Own water and juice was allowed too. The free WIFI service inside the park was good enough for us to share our memories in real time. Ensure to check out the time and place of the meet & greet of all the Disney characters from the guide map available in the park's entrance. Each Disney character is out only for a short time (approx. 30 mins) so get there early or you won't get to meet them. The food at the restaurants wasn't too attractive or delicious however we still had a heavy meal to stay active until the fireworks. We were free in the evening but were eager to stay till the Paint the Night parade and the fireworks. So we grabbed the best seats on the benches right in front of the Sleeping Beauty Castle. Even though the weather looks pleasant ensure to carry warm clothes during winters as staying out in open for the shows can give you a wind chill effect. I personally found the oe day ticket to be good enough as we with planning we covered everything and enjoyed nearly 99% of the attractions. I used the fast pass for Space Mountain and one more ride and it worked like a charm, no long queues :) Though everyone says DON'T BRING SELFIE STICK which i even confirmed with Disneyland team, i could still see a lot of guests with these sticks inside the park. As suggested by someone here i took an autograph book and got many characters happily sign it. My daughter went gaga over our idea and is still very thankful. Thanks to my dear Tripadvisor friend for that suggestion!Keep enough space and charge on your cameras phones for videos and pictures until the fireworks as you would love to capture every moment for a lifetime. Disneyland is must visit for people of all age. My wife and i enjoyed the Cinderella Carousel like kids... The video recording still brings smiles to our faces :)",Disneyland_HongKong

449654704,5,2017-1,United Kingdom,"I'd heard mixed things before coming to HK Disney and as a big fan of Disney parks  we've done Florida and Anaheim in the last 18 months, I was worried that this small park would fail in comparison. But to my delight this was not true.There is enough familiar to be Disney but enough different to delight. I loved the it's a small world that includes Disney characters. Where we in other rides spot the country, here we were hunting the characters! Look out for our favourites, the 3 cabelleros! We were so lucky the Iron Man ride had just opened and this was awesome. As fans of Star Tours, we were familiar with the concept. But still found the ride a thrill!Apparently the park is always quiet til lunchtime. We certainly found this. We queued for nothing till around parade time 3pm. So arrive early as you will feel like you have the park just for yourself.The shows  Mickey book and Lion King were up their with the best Disney park shows I've seen. The Lion King is different to the Animal Kingdom one so not to be missed. The parades  again, up there with the best. I particularly loved the Electrical Light show just before fireworks. We had no problem having good viewing even for my 4 years old. He danced the whole way through!I was surprised that the retail experience was not as huge as I thought. Ok, I might be comparing to WDW but I had thought the Chinese would be up on the whole Disney merchandise?! What was really different was an absence of Disney t shirts other than on western visitors. I feel out of place without my Mickey T in a US theme park. Here I didn't see a princess,pirate or personalised family party at all!I love Chinese food. But my one suggestion, and my one fail was to try traditional Chinese food on my family at Disney. This is not the place to experiment on them! Stick to what you know they will eat   to boost up their energy levels and hit the park!And consider doing 2 days if you are a real fan.

Are GREAT",Disneyland_HongKong
449172452,2,2016-12,Switzerland,expectations where high as i thought it will be better than euro disney...but by far is Hong Kong DL an smaller and really boring park.

449159556,5,2016-12,United Kingdom,"We visited on a Saturday in early December. We only had two days in Hong Kong, so had no choice but to visit on a weekend. I was a bit worried that it would be very busy so I made sure we arrived early. When we arrived we walked straight in and there were no ques at all for atleast the first hour! It did get busier as the day went on, but everything was bearable (I think the maximum wait we had was about 20 minutes during the peak of the day).I've visited most of the other Disney Parks throughout the world, this one is noticeably smaller. However they had plenty of  meet and greets  with the characters throughout the day, and lots of photo opportunities! We managed to get our pictures taken with atleast 4 different Disney characters during the day. I didn't see as many opportunities for these kind of pictures in the other Disney parks I visited, so this was definitely a highlight.Would highly recommend a visit to Hong Kong Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong

We watched the afternoon and the night parade which was fantastic but people were so so pushy. We had a 2 yr old with us and nobody even cared about pushing you around with her in your arms. The lines all had reasonable wait times, and there was so much to see and do  I'm not even sure we saw it all. Our 13 yr old boy had the best time. And there was lots for our little one to do. She LOVED it's a small world... And so did us adults secretly ;) Food was very limited and very average  that is why they lost a star! ",Disneyland_HongKong

Very appropriate for their age however you have to be organized as the shows and character  meet and greets  have strict times. It is a good idea to download the app which is live and gives tells you waiting times at the different rides. The Lion King show was nice, the Parade at 4pm was fabulous.I didn't think we would last 3 hours there but we were there from 10am to 7pm .

We went around ten am and the park just opened so the queues were not that long but the lines get crowded by lunchtime. I suggest you get on the disney railroad and start from the attractions from a far so the lines are still not that long since most of the people are on the nearby attractions, then do the shows and the photographs with the characters later. Parade is at 330 and is also fun to watch and the fireworks. ",Disneyland_HongKong

448515268,5,2017-1,Australia,HK Disney was a fantastic day trip. Previous Disney experience told us to get there early (there's a 10% early bird discount on purchases) and hit the roller coasters first. So we go in some repeated trips in space mountain and the grizzly Gulch before the crowds got bigger and lines got longer. Toy story land was one of our favourite lands   some unexpected great rides! Make sure you check out the lion king show   Amazing!We settled in half an hour before the parade and had a great view. Have fun! ,Disneyland_HongKong

We bought the 2 days tickets for the weekend and surprisingly it was not crowded as we thought it would be. It was drizzling and slightly windy on Saturday so that might have been the reason it was empty. The afternoon parade on that day was also different due to the weather. On Sunday, the weather was perfect so naturally there were more people and the lines to the attractions were longer, but we never waited more than 30 minutes which is nothing compared to what you have to wait in other amusement parks.

448414552,4,2016-12,Australia,"Last year we visited Disneyworld in Florida with our 8 year old in June and its huge offering would have needed a full week to enjoy. This time our visit to Hong Kong Disneyland over Christmas was a lot more relaxed. For one thing the Park is far smaller, more compact and less crowds and lining up. Also the weather was perfect, whilst winter, it was a mild 21 degrees most days. I wouldn't recommend going in June which in Hong Kong (like Florida) is just stifling hot and humid.Disneyworld is easily accessible by MTR from Hong Kong central. After two days we had been on most rides. Thankfully the new new Ironman ride had a soft opening and it was great, incorporating the Hong Kong skyline into the ride with great effect. The other rides were good and our 8 year old had a great time. There is a wild Star Wars roller coaster ride as well but not much else of Star Wars other than the Jedi Training academy and a lot of merchandise. The evening fire works also were fun.The great thing is for an Australian, Hong Kong is only 9 hours flight away and in Aussie time zones compared to the US with both Anaheim and Orlando big flights for kids.We will now only go back to Disney once the new Star Wars worlds are open in the US, that will be worth travelling for!!",Disneyland_HongKong

This is my dream place for a pre wedding pictorial.One day is not enough to enjoy the place. No long lines, only 5minute wait with all the rides and attraction. Explore first! Don't shop at the first two hours of your stay in Disneyland.It is expensive, we expected that so we wanted good service. Maybe it's the culture thing but the staff could be more polite.

Many attractions close by 2000 even though fireworks are at 2100. The positive was that there was not the crowds at all that Disneyworld sees and so no waiting for rides. (Longest was 30 mins) and that was rare. My teenagers rode hyperspace mountain 7 times. I am a huge Disney fan and so was glad we went however would not go back. ( I have been to Disneyworld 5 times and would return).

The park is advertised as open til 9pm.In addition the parade takes place in total darkness and you can't move around freely for fear of falling in the dark or being robbed. This is a danger for both older and younger people.We did approach the Disneyland staff to complain about the price of the tickets   given they were charged at a full rate  with no after 5pm rate applicable and only portion of the park available to access.

Fast pass is useless since all attractions took less than 30 minutes waiting. For the Star War ride, by the end of the day, there was no line up. My kids and I had three rides back to back.

The overpopulation in the park and the mass of people make the trip unbareable to be honest. The huge dissappointed and specially when you know Disney Paris, Florida or California...

It is very small for a theme park standard, it has limited number of rides and most of which are, although very child friendly, boring. The scenery however, was extraordinary. They perfectly captured the essence of every theme, some themes however, somehow gave the impression that they were minor attractions basically because there were little to no rides in them at all.

Frequent opportunities for pictures with characters.  Loved the main strip... especially the afternoon parade. Don't miss that!!!! The evening fireworks are great. We went for Christmas and they even shot out fake snow onto the main strip. My little girls loved that.  Decorated well for the season. Cons: Price! So expensive. Nearly everything costs something. There's a lot of commercials, too. They make you exit via gift shops. That's common for a park, but not after individual rides. You'd think the high price of admission would cover other things. But I guess that keeps away the masses.  it's DisneyLand in Hong Kong. Where is Mulan?! Seriously, Disney... how was this overlooked? Maybe she's in ShangHai, now that they have a park there.

More than anything else Disney parade, fire works, Chris tree lighting and meeting you favourite Disney character is an experience in itself. If you have a young kid then you are going to have a fielded day. One day is not sufficient to cover all fun. We visited it for 2 days.

I was especially pleased we got to try out the brand new Iron Man ride, which was slot of fun. This park is superior in the sense they had much more content available in English as compared the the Japanese parks.However we quickly came to realise the park is particularly small! I would say after three hours or so we'd seen the whole park and all the attractions we were interested in.The place is well run and we'll staffed. But for the very high ticket prices they charge, I'm not sure three or four hours is value for money. The twin Japanese parks give you slot more bang for your buck.One other note was the stupid prices for food inside the park. I guess one should just expect to get gouged for everything at a theme park, but they seem to have mastered the art at HK Disney. A very average and plain cheeseburger cost $26 AUD. I paid less than that for a burger at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant! So if you remember, bring some stuff with you.",Disneyland_HongKong

But this has almost improved version of each ride we have been to the USA disney parks Wonderous Book show(new show) is awesome and must see. Lion king is equally impressive. We have a 6 year old and he could qualify for all the RED tagged roller coasters. He just fell in love with the parade and fake snow right afterwards in the main street area. Do the most desired rides early to avoid crowds and do take fast pass for the ones where you hit long lines.

After all, Hong Kong has been in the service industry for a longer time.I found the service of the staff unfriendly and in no way giving their guests a magical day. We were asking for directions and the staff will just point and say the name of the place. I know the name of the place, but I am expecting more details like turn left or right and when.... and in the midst of me still trying to get more details for direction, the girl went to answer the phone! I was so disgusted by this unfriendly and rude attitude.

The attractions that i definatelly recommend are Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain and Hyperspace Mountain, also a nice show with 4D movie   Mickey's Philarmagic.Not to be missed here, in my oppinion, are also the fireworks at the castle, the  Paint the night  parade and during the winter holidays, the Christmas tree lighting show.",Disneyland_HongKong
447097060,3,2016-12,India,"I visited this place with less expectations.. and i did righti It has lot of offerings for kids, but very less for age of 30's. You may like few thrilling rides along with a good company.But vegetarian guys just be ready for fasting, since hardly you will get there something to eat.Anyways still there is something that you can enjoy.",Disneyland_HongKong
447084494,4,2016-12,Hong Kong,"Not many people would go visit this Hong Kong Disney now, probably mainly because of the drop in mainland china tourists, for the opening of the shanghai one, or simply currency reasons etc. Favourable to anyone who'd like to try out a less crowded version of the Park. Have what it advertised of cause. Expect what you would expect, just less crowded. ",Disneyland_HongKong
447065940,5,2016-12,Malaysia,"Even though most of the rides, characters meet and greet are for younger children, me and my 13yr teenage daughter enjoyed strolling along the park, watching the street performances and the parades, and went on a few rides.We love the breathtaking lighting effects & music of  Disney Paint the Night  Nighttime Spectacular at 7.30pm. The cheerful vibes are contagious! We had a blast on the Toy Soldier Parachute Drop, Slinky Dog Spin, Orbitron and HK Disneyland Railroad that goes round the park. We also visited Chewbacca & R2 D2 at the Star Wars Command Post located at the Tomorrowland. We skipped a few of the popular rides due to the crowds.Food & beverages are more expensive along the Main Street area, we bought 3 medium sized fried shrimps with chips for HKD48 at the Lucky Nugget Saloon, Grizzly Gulch after our visit to Toy Story Land. The portions are just right for us if compared to the food served at the cafe at the Main Street, and there was no wastage of unfinished food.Overall, there are varieties of entertainment catered to different age groups of park visitors, and Disney sure has the magic to make this happen!",Disneyland_HongKong

446907264,3,2016-12,Australia,Spent the day at HK Disneyland with 2 kids aged 10 and 14 at cost $380 just to get in the gate. There were some good 3D shows and roller coaster ride they enjoyed but found most rides more for younger kids. Food and drinks really expensive which we expected but $6 for a coke and $138HKD for a small curry and rice or $6 for a hotdog on a stick. Glad we only paid for a one day pass as did not consider it good value when also had to wait I ver an hour to get on some rides. Parade at 3pm was good. Not sure would bother going again.,Disneyland_HongKong
446885730,3,2016-12,Thailand,We just got back from disneyland. And we were very disappointed. We expected a lot more rides for our age group but it was mostly for the kids. I guess if you are 30 . It's better to go to Ocean park.,Disneyland_HongKong
446885658,5,2016-12,United Kingdom,Fantastic time with two boys aged 4 and 9. We have been on Christmas day and in the morning waiting time was Very reasonable (close to none for some attractions). Only major minus from me is food drink prices   total rip off!! So prepare drinks and snacks before you go!Park itself is not to big and I think one day is enough if planned well in advance   it was however our first trip to any Disney resort so got no comparison to other parks.,Disneyland_HongKong

The ticket is bit expensive and kids & adults can really enjoy it i hope.. ,Disneyland_HongKong
446840674,4,2016-5,India,Disneyland is a good place to visit in Hong Kong specifically if you have kids along with you. Even adults would have a good time here as there are lots of rides which even adults can enjoy.,Disneyland_HongKong
446819627,4,2016-12,Singapore,"Special day out for my 9 year old daughter The park is very impressive and certainly worth a visit.I would recommend a visit outside of holiday periods as it seemed that most of Hong Kong was also visiting on the same day.It was extremely busy, which is a reflection on how good the park is.",Disneyland_HongKong
446818272,5,2016-11,Hong Kong,"Ok, I shall agree that once you are in Hong Kong and don't have enough time, you may skip Disney park. However, ir you are a Disney lover, or if you are in HK with children, you definitely should visit the park. The smallest Disney park among the current six, HK Disney carries the soul of Disney, the magic of Disney universe and the people who make HK Disneyland happen every day will make sure that the visitors are having a nice time while visiting them. As a hint, if you don't like hot weather, avoid visiting the park on summer.",Disneyland_HongKong

Good price value for your money lots of game and sites to visit but the problem is the cue takes most of your time. Didn't get the chance to do the roller coaster because of the rain but it was a great experience though... ,Disneyland_HongKong
446804623,4,2016-5,Ukraine,"We went there early in the morning, we took a taxi instead of MTR which costed us a bit more. At the entrance they check all bags, and we purchased two tickets and went in, it is not very big, small a bit, wear comfortable shoes, it is mostly more fun for younger children, still interesting for adults. There were a lot of people from China and a few from Hong Kong, some from the States, and Europe. The people from China, kept cutting the lines, a few times I had to say,  Hello, do you not see us standing here? , Another place we were waiting to see a show, and there wasn't any indication of where line started and ended just all people standing everywhere which was really horrible. All the Chinese pushed it was a bit crazy, and foreigners looks at each other like Oh My Gosh and we were all laughing even though we don't know each other. I would not recommend to go during summer, too hot. Choose a cooler season. Wear sun screen if you go during summer, might burn a bit. Food there was delicious, we had a few coffees to cool us off, we went during beginning of May. It is different than the one in USA, or China. Best to go there not during Chinese holidays otherwise, too many people and bad behaviours. You can buy the food there, it is not crazy high prices, and have water since you will be standing in lines to get in. We finished late and we tried to get a taxi, was not simple, we didn't know which taxi's to take and etc, so we asked and people were helpful. Outside the DisneyLand there is a fountain, and a nice picture location. Enjoy DisneyLand",Disneyland_HongKong
446802238,5,2016-12,South Africa,"We chose HK Disneyland rather than Disney World, Orlando specifically because its small size matched my daughter. All the mist see characters were there and the Tinker Bell meet and greet was precious. Pricey, but totally worth it.",Disneyland_HongKong
446661811,5,2016-11,Malaysia,"My hubby decided to choose here over Macau during our HK holiday trip since neither of us have been to any Disneyland yet and this is the closest.I've to say, we enjoyed it thoroughly and with such a fine, cool winter weather end of the year, it make our walk more enjoyable without the sweat during summer time.Although it may be the smallest among all Disneyland, it still took us a full day to walk, ride, eat, shop and we managed to catch two parades; one in the afternoon and the other during night time. The only thing we didn't managed to do was to catch and take a close up photos with all the Disney characters due to the timing that's scheduled.In terms of transportation, there is a direct MTR from Hong Kong station to Disneyland, which you have to interchange at Sunny Bay and you will come across a Mickey Mouse decorated MTR trains to Disneyland. It is advisable to go during weekdays when it is less crowded compared to weekend. Also, with me at my second trimester pregnancy, most of the rides are pregnancy friendly with one or two rides only. To me, this was more than good enough for me as I was able to still enjoy 95% of the rides.I definitely wouldn't mind going back again if I am in HK.",Disneyland_HongKong
446634547,5,2016-12,Philippines,"We came on the eve of Christmas and it was a memorable experience for the family. I suggest you always get an advanced booking to save time for queueing. Got a lot lesser queue. Prices also are up during holiday seasons just like the whole HK. 1 day won't suffice if you want to take all the rides. Our whole day covered what was necessary. We arrived at 10 am and had the following:1. Tram ride around the park to give us an overview2. Watched Festival of the Lion King (5 star) in the theater in the wild followed by the Jungle Book and Boat ride3. Early lunch4. Watched Mickey and the Wondrous Book    quite a good time to nap5. Flights of Fantasy parade along the main street, but sit along the streets near Fantasy land Tomorrowland6. Rode the good rides: Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars in the Grizzly grunch, and from Toy Story land: toy soldier parachute drop and RC racer7. Just in time for the 7pm Disney Paint the Night8. Tomorrowland's not so awesome Hyperspace Mountain (No sudden drops, just swinging fast) and a photo ops with Star Wars characters9. Disney in the Stars fireworks.

446627152,4,2016-12,Singapore,"The kids and I were glad to see some Star Wars attractions and rides at Tomorrowland and slowly taking over it, but also relieved that Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters is still around. We enjoyed blasting away at the Zurg that we had to take the ride twice! Hyperspace mountain which has you in a X Wing evading Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters was just too thrilling   it's twists and turns, and sudden drops and stops are not for the faint hearted! A crowd favorite is the Slinky Dog Spin   we managed to try it this time, but not in our previous 2 visits to the park as the kids were younger then and did not have the patience nor the stamina for the 30 minute (at least) queue! For the Christmas festive period, there was a Christmas tree light up and fireworks in the evening as well!",Disneyland_HongKong

Most of the things in disneyland is mostly want to attract kids so mostly are for kids but for a 19yr old me, I really do love it. The most unhappy thing of this trip to disneyland is where before you enter, they will need to check ur bags. The girl call me to throw the fried rice i had in my bag away because I cannot bring in. My mum is a vegetarian and disneyland doesnt have vegetarian food so the fried rice i bring is in case she is hungry but she call me to throw. At last I throw but I am still mad at her for making me throwing it. ",Disneyland_HongKong

446487156,5,2016-4,United States,"Maybe this review is bias because I love amusement parks, Goofy, Minnie Mouse ears, fireworks, and I was proposed to in front of the castle. Hong Kong Disney is wonderful! The magic begins before you even arrive to the park. If you take the train, you are picked up by the Mickey Mouse train which is decked out in Disney decor and playing all of your favorite Disney tunes. You also get to dote over the cute little girls dressed in Disney princess wear. Adorable! Mickey tells you to have a magical day and you automatically decide that you will.We stayed at the resort which is amazing in and of itself. The shuttles to Disney are frequent and convenient. The rides are fun and totally make you feel like a kid.You must see the fireworks show at the end of the night. My lovely fiance proposed to me under the fireworks and I loved it! My dream come true!

446413326,5,2016-11,India,"A total cheerful place, awesome time spent with family and friends.A must visit place and worth waiting for the Night Parade and Fireworks.I'd say for anyone visiting, download a map online first and ask people what all things are must watch, that way your time is spent wisely.",Disneyland_HongKong
446411882,4,2016-1,China,We loved visiting Disneyland!

446393482,3,2016-12,Australia,"Went there as part of a family group so it wasn't top of my pick though the child did enjoy it. Farcical entry method, we bought tickets on line and then proceeded to wait in line for half an hour or so. Various other problems resulting in a wait of 1 hour. Crowded place and difficult to battle your way through. Food expensive, basically you get ripped off. Very few places to sit down and watch the goings on. Saw two parades which were quite good but not the place I would go to again.",Disneyland_HongKong
446386997,5,2016-12,United States,"I am a vacation club member with Disney and have traveled the world with my membership, but this was the fist park I have been to outside of LA or Orlando. I couldn't have made a better decision. The hotel, park, transportation, service, food, etc has been most excellent. I am visiting from East Africa and this is such a breath of fresh air for my family. This place is pristine and very well taken care of. It is what I expect from Disney and they have not disappointed. ",Disneyland_HongKong
446283256,5,2016-12,Singapore,"First, we booked Hong Kong Disneyland tickets via Klook. It is definitely cheaper than buying through Disneyland website. Plus there are discounts for first timer users of Klook. After buying through Klook, we received the vouchers via email, printed them out and brought them on our trip to HK. Reaching HK Disneyland, we headed straight to the main entrance turnstiles. The staff simply scanned the QR Codes on our printed vouchers and in we went. It was very fast. While the Hong Kong Disneyland is small compared to others around the world, the atmosphere was great and the waiting time of the rides weren't that long. I really appreciated how Hong Kong Disneyland is the only Disneyland with a restaurant serving halal food. As a Muslim traveller, halal food can be hard to find at times. While the prices for the food are steep, I truly appreciated that they serve halal food at the Explorer's Club. For a standard meal, it costs HK$139. All the rides were okay, nothing death defying. Kids would enjoy the rides more. Personally, I was there for the Disney experience rather than for the rides. Two noteworthy rides are the Grizzly Gulch and RC Racer. The Lion King show is a must watch. The show was impressive. If you want front row seats to the show, you need to be there in the queue one hour early. But regardless of where you seat, you'll thoroughly enjoy the show. In fact, sitting too close to the stage may not do you good for a positive experience. Do go for Disney's Philharmagic 3D Concert. As the name suggests, you'll be given 3D glasses to put on for the show. Get ready for the experience as you'll feel the wind in your face, and the splash of water (Yes! we got a little bit wet from the sprinkle of water during the show). I thoroughly enjoyed the Parade at 3.30pm and the 7pm Parade. It was then that we saw all the Disney's characters. Do seat at the parade grounds early. Like literally seat on the ground for an up close view of the parade. People were already seated on grounds along the Parade route at 2.50pm. The fireworks at 9pm were also just as great. The music and the images on the castle added to a great fireworks display. As we were leaving and walking along Main Street USA, they released snow from the rooftops! It added to the magic of the Disneyland experience. Amazing time!",Disneyland_HongKong

446163616,4,2016-12,Singapore,Great theme park though small. Park is still maintained in good condition. Stark Iron Man attraction in Tomorrowland due to open in Jan 2017. Universal Studios Transformers ride is much better than Iron Man ride. More realistic and effects. Some attractions are conducted in Cantonese. Need to check the timing schedules for English sessions. Lion King and Mickey's Wonderous Book shows are good and the theatres get filled rather quickly.Hope to see more attractions added soon to justify the increase in park ticket prices.,Disneyland_HongKong

Take a map to visit all its attractions like Fairyland, toyland, star wars and many more in the list. Few essential things to pack on your way to disneyland are water, sunscreen, umbrella and sun glasses. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes as you need to walk a lot inside.

445787865,5,2016-12,Japan,"We literally just arrived back at our hotel from our trip to HKD and it was fabulous. We went on a rainy Wednesday in December. First, the longest wait was 20 minutes (RC Racer and Slinky in Toyland). Second, the park is rather small, which makes for shorter distances between rides  although I still logged 15,482 steps. Third, the rides that are unique to HKD are actually REALLY cool. In my opinion; Mystic Manor is much better than the Haunted Mansion. Hyperspace Mountain completely incorporates Star Wars into the ride, which is fun. And Big Grizzly Mt. Runaway Mine Cars (insanely long name) was this amazing combination of Thunder Mt, Aerosmith, and Everest! All with less than a 5 minute wait. As with most Disney properties outside the US, the food and souvenirs are more reasonably priced but the food can be tricky if you have picky eaters. English is spoken widely and fluently. Oh and there are stickers for the kids to collect; just ask the staff. We took our family of 5, ate a full lunch, had several snacks, bought a custom lightsaber, sweatshirt, t shirt, pack of socks (it rained we had wet feet), a few other small items, and the grand total was right at $500. Not bad for Disney. Bottomline: I wouldn't advise traveling to Hong Kong FOR Disneyland, but if you are here, and can go on a weekday, go for it! You won't regret it.",Disneyland_HongKong
445761124,3,2016-12,Malaysia,"The train ride from Sunny bay to Disneyland is worth taking. There is always a huge rush from the morning. Better to reach the park at 10 am. Book your tickets in advance to skip the queue. Evening parade and light show are never to be missed. Better to be seated at 5.30 pm as it becomes very crowded at 6.The live shows ( Lion king, etc), Mickey 3D show are worth watching. Fast pass is mainly for Meet and Greet characters. It is a small park if you compare with Orlando.

If you want to had dinner   lunch, you can try one of Maxim's Restaurant there. They had a yummy beef brisket menu.",Disneyland_HongKong
445453366,5,2016-12,Hong Kong,Christmas in Disneyland. Need I or anyone say more ? With the addition of the Star Wars franchise its definitely a step up. We were there during Ng the premier of the Iron man offering. Unfortunately we didn't have access to it. (Seemed like an invite only thing; and they were not too polite about it. Sad but won't lose sleep)Beware when signing up for the photo package. It's not worth it. Even thought is like slightly lesser than HKD400. Still that can buy you more popcorn and toys!!!!,Disneyland_HongKong
445131371,4,2016-12,Hong Kong,"Once again this park is magical. It's Disney so it's good right? The ride times are generally around 10 45 minutes on weekdays and 35 65 minutes on weekends or public holidays. Hong Kong Disneyland is smaller than most parks, but it is still super fun. Don't forget to ask the cast members for stickers and ride everything in toy story land, Grizzly Gulch, and Mystic Manor since these are exclusive to Hong Kong Disneyland. Also, Iron Man Experience opens January 2017, I look forward to riding it!",Disneyland_HongKong
445122443,5,2016-12,Australia,"Went there with my family. Easily accesible via the MTR. Ticket was about 1200 hong kong dollar for my wife, 16 months baby and myself.We had a good time and surprisingly it was not over crowded. Most rides had only 15 to 20 minutes wait and the longest queue was about 40 minutes. My wifes second visit and she says it has improved a lot since her first visit. There is free wifi throughout most of the park and that worked well with the disneyland app.Recommended for young couple with kids!",Disneyland_HongKong
445103817,4,2016-11,Australia,"We had a great day at Disneyland. Wasn't very busy when we visited, minimal wait for rides. Park was very clean and well maintained. Merchandise was well priced, not overly expensive. Main street parade was great. Definately worth a visit if your in Hong Kong :) ",Disneyland_HongKong
445024911,4,2016-12,New Zealand,This was our 2nd visit to a Disneyland (1st being Paris). In comparison this was more focused towards a younger audience as a lot of the rides were gentler.It was super easy to get there taking the Tung Chung line to Sunny Bay and then changing onto the Disneyland Resort line.We arrived around 11am on Thursday (15th Dec) and overall the park was reasonably quiet (longest wait time was around 40mins with on average we waited about 20mins per ride).The best ride was the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars followed by the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters. Everything else was pretty average.We missed the parade but highly recommend the Lion King theatre   this in itself is worth the park ticket,Disneyland_HongKong
